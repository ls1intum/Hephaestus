/**
 * Rescans the first-party images built from `main` against the release vulnerability policy.
 *
 * Container CVEs are time-dependent, not commit-dependent: the commit that was clean when it merged
 * becomes vulnerable days later with nothing in the repository having changed. The build-time gate in
 * `reusable-docker-build.yml` catches change-driven regressions and cannot catch this, so v0.75.0 was
 * blocked by findings whose first appearance was the release itself.
 *
 * This walks the `images` half of `security/release-images.json`; the pinned upstream half is
 * `scan-upstream-images.ts`, and `ci-contract.test.ts` asserts the two together cover exactly what
 * the release evidence gate demands. Both share `lib/image-scan.ts`, which hands each Trivy report
 * to `check-release-vulnerabilities.ts`.
 *
 * A finding never fails this run. `report-vulnerability-drift.ts` reads the `.policy.json` files
 * written here and routes them to a tracking issue; only an infrastructure failure — a missing tag, an
 * unreachable registry, a Trivy crash — is worth a red status on a schedule nobody triggered.
