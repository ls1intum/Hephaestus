/**
 * Parses every committed diagram with the mermaid the docs site actually resolves — both the standalone
 * `.mmd` files and the ```mermaid blocks fenced inside `.md` and `.mdx`.
 *
 * Docusaurus renders mermaid in the browser, so a diagram it cannot parse builds green and publishes
 * as an error box on the page. That is how the generated ER schema shipped unreadable: the resolved
 * mermaid rejected `NUMERIC(12,6)`, and nothing in the toolchain had an opinion about it.
 *
 * The fenced blocks are the ones a person edits by hand and the only ones with a way to be wrong, so
 * a version of this gate that reads only the generated `.mmd` file checks almost nothing while still
 * printing a count. Whatever narrows the scope of this file, it must not be that distinction.
 *
 * Two regressions are in scope, which is why this reads the resolved package rather than pinning a
 * version here: a column type the generator emits that mermaid cannot read, and a transitive bump
 * that takes the parser backwards.
