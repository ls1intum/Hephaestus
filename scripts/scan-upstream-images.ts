/**
 * Scans the upstream images `security/release-images.json` pins by digest.
 *
 * These four — alpine, nats, nginx, traefik — are shipped by `docker/compose.*.yaml` and covered by
 * the release evidence gate, but nothing built them, so neither the build-time gate in
 * `reusable-docker-build.yml` nor `scan-main-images.ts` had a subject for them. The gap was found by
 * a release: v0.75.0 failed at the evidence gate on a finding in the pinned alpine digest that had
 * been there for days (issue #1741).
 *
 * They need no build — a digest in a committed file is the whole subject — so this is cheap and
 * deterministic, and it blocks by default. A Renovate digest bump edits this very file, so the pull
 * request proposing the bump is the one that scans it.
 *
 * `--report-only` is the weekly rescan, where a finding is routed to a tracking issue rather than a
 * red status: a CVE published after the digest was pinned belongs to no commit, and a pinned
 * upstream image cannot be patched by rebuilding anything here.
