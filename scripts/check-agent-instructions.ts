/**
 * An instruction file that no agent loads fails in complete silence.
 *
 * Claude Code discovers a nested `CLAUDE.md` and never a nested `AGENTS.md`
 * (https://code.claude.com/docs/en/memory), so a package guide reaches it only through a `CLAUDE.md`
 * beside it that imports it. Every check here is that defect from a different side — a pointer into
 * content, with nothing verifying the pointer arrives:
 *
 *   symlinked   — an agent file committed as a symlink, which a Windows checkout gets as text.
 *   unreachable — an `AGENTS.md` the `CLAUDE.md` beside it does not import.
 *   dangling    — an `@` reference resolving to nothing.
 *   uncovered   — an `AGENTS.md` no opencode `instructions` entry matches, or an entry matching none.
 *   uncommanded — a typed-only skill with no opencode command to type.
 *   unmirrored  — a Codex copy of a skill that has drifted from the Claude Code original.
 *   duplicated  — two agent files with one body.
 *
 * Contributor docs are checked separately for inline-code paths and npm packages that resolve to
 * nothing in the checkout.
 *
 * `unread` runs before all of them and reports this gate's own blind spot: an agent file the
 * classifier never opened, which every check below would otherwise read as a file that says nothing.
 *
 * The file set is `git ls-files --cached --others --exclude-standard`, read from the working tree
 * rather than the index: `pnpm run check` runs before `git add`, so a gate answering about the last
 * commit would disagree with the tree in front of you.
