/**
 * Decides whether a commit on `main` cuts a release, and which release it follows.
 *
 * The question is *does the version on `main` have a published release yet*, not *did this commit
 * change the version*. A release that fails leaves the version consumed — the Version PR is merged
 * and the changesets it folded in are gone — so a decision keyed on the version commit can only be
 * retried by reverting that commit, which the changeset freeze rules block by construction and which
 * needed an administrator bypass all three times it was done (issues #1686, #1691, #1701). Keyed on
 * the version, the same release re-cuts from the next commit that carries the fix, which is how
 * everything else here recovers.
 *
 * That leaves four cases, in this order:
 *
 *   1. the version's release is published — the ordinary feature merge, and the only no-op;
 *   2. a draft of it targets another commit — refused, because resuming it would publish that
 *      commit's images under this tag; the operator deletes the draft to re-cut here;
 *   3. a draft of it targets this commit — cut, resuming the draft an attempt left behind;
 *   4. no release of it exists — cut, whether or not this commit changed the version.
 *
 * The precondition that a release must follow a published one compares against the latest published
 * release rather than the parent commit's version: on a re-cut the parent carries the same
 * unpublished version, and a parent comparison would refuse the very retry this exists to allow. It
 * is also what keeps the promotion of `X.Y`, `latest` and the staging deploy moving forward — a
 * version that is not newer than the latest published release is refused rather than cut.
