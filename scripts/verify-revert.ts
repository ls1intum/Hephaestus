/**
 * Decides whether a pull request is a *verified revert*.
 *
 * The changeset freeze rules — MIGRATION.md is not editable, pending changesets and migration
 * fragments are not deletable — describe how a feature moves forward. A revert of a release
 * commit necessarily restores every one of them, so it can never satisfy the guard, and the three
 * release reverts so far each needed an administrator bypass. A guard that has to be bypassed on a
 * known-good path teaches people to bypass it.
 *
 * The exemption is deliberately structural rather than lexical: the pull request title and branch
 * name are never read, because both are attacker-chosen. A pull request qualifies only when *every*
 * non-merge commit it adds over the base
 *
 *   1. carries exactly one `This reverts commit <sha>.` line, the trailer `git revert` writes,
 *   2. names a commit that exists and is an ancestor of the base — already reviewed and merged,
 *   3. names a commit with a single parent — reverting a merge is out of scope, and
 *   4. has a patch identical to that commit's patch reversed, compared by `git patch-id --stable`
 *      over a `--binary` diff, so neither an extra hunk nor an altered binary payload can ride
 *      along.
 *
 * Anything else — an unrelated commit in the range, a fabricated trailer, a conflict-resolved
 * revert whose patch no longer matches — leaves the guard fully in force. The check fails closed.
