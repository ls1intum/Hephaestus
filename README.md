# Hephaestus — Process-Aware Mentoring for Agile Software Teams

Hephaestus is an open-source platform for process-aware mentoring that scaffolds self-regulated learning and onboarding for agile software teams. The platform focuses on the software process — from issues to pull requests and team rituals — to bridge the theory–practice gap and help novices adopt industry best practices faster with less struggle. Heph is the platform’s conversational AI mentor that delivers repo-grounded guidance.

Hephaestus /hɪˈfɛstəs/ is the Greek god of blacksmiths, craftsmen, and artisans, symbolizing the fusion of creativity and technical skill.

## Main Features

1. **Code Review Gamification**

   - **Weekly Leaderboard:** Stay motivated with a dynamic leaderboard that updates in real time via GitHub integration. Earn points for review activity, view detailed stats, and easily copy pull request links.

   - **Team Competitions:** Foster a collaborative spirit with team leaderboards spanning multiple repositories and options to filter the associated activities via labels.

   - **Leagues:** Engage in a structured league system where consistent review efforts build an Elo-like ranking — adding a competitive edge to your code reviews.

   - **Automated Recognition:** Celebrate excellence with weekly Slack notifications that honor the top three reviewers and link directly to the previous week's leaderboard.

2. **Heph (Conversational AI Mentor)**

   - **SRL-guided reflection:** Run structured, AI-assisted sessions that support self-regulated learning (goals → strategies → reflection) tailored to agile project work.
   - **Automated standups:** Turn weekly insights into a concise standup table to streamline team communication and accountability.
   - **Repo context awareness:** Ground guidance in actual activity (issues, commits, reviews, PRs) to deliver objective, data-informed feedback and next steps.

## Roadmap

- **Short Term:** Implement AI-based bad practices detection for pull request descriptions to ensure quality before merging by notifying the author of potential issues via email or GitHub comments.
- **Short Term:** Develop initial workspace support by moving environment variable configuration into a user-friendly workspace settings UI for setting up API credentials, webhooks, etc.
- **Short Term:** Streamline project setup and improve contributor accessibility by enhancing documentation and onboarding resources.
- **Medium Term:** Expand multi-workspace capabilities to allow configuration of multiple organizations and selected open-source repositories, enabling seamless integration into diverse GitHub projects.
- **Medium Term:** Integrate GitLab support to cater to self-hosted Git platforms, particularly for educational contexts.
- **Medium Term:** Develop an advanced mentor prompt scheduler tailored for project-based courses, enabling daily reflective sessions and guided adaptation to evolving project requirements.
- **Medium Term:** Enhance the gamification system with additional features and further expand Heph's capabilities.
- **Long Term:** Proactively integrate with GitHub and GitLab to deliver feedback directly via comments on issues or pull requests.
- **Long Term:** Launch a peer-to-peer recognition system to reward high-quality reviews and establish a review quality assurance mechanism.
