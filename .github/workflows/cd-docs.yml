# Documentation Deployment Pipeline
#
# Separation of Concerns:
# - CI: Quality gate in ci-quality-gates.yml validates docs build
# - CD: This workflow handles deployment only (GitHub Pages + PR previews)
#
# Triggers:
# - push to main with docs changes: Deploy to GitHub Pages
# - PR with docs changes: Deploy preview to Surge.sh with comment
#
# Best Practices (2025):
# - Path filtering prevents unnecessary runs
# - Surge.sh teardown removes preview when PR closes
# - Uses upload-pages-artifact@v3 and deploy-pages@v4 per GitHub requirements
# - Docusaurus build caching for faster deploys
