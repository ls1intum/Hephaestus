# Additional Hints

## Shadcn instructions (UI components)

If needed, check `src/components/ui` for existing components before you install new ones.

Use the latest version of Shadcn to install new components, like this command to add a button component:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add button
```

## Ensure build success

After being done with implementation, make sure to run the build command to check for any issues:

```bash
npm run build
```
