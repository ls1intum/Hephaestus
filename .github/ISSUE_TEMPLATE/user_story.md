<!--
FEATURE GUIDELINES:
- One feature per issue—split large features into multiple issues
- Use the user story format to clarify who benefits and why
- Acceptance criteria should be testable (a reviewer can verify each one)
- Link mockups/designs when available—even rough sketches help

GOOD USER STORIES:
  ✓ As a team lead, I want to export leaderboard data as CSV so that I can share metrics in presentations.
  ✓ As a new user, I want to see an onboarding tour so that I understand the main features.

BAD USER STORIES:
  ✗ Add CSV export (missing who and why)
  ✗ As a user, I want it to be better (too vague)
-->
