 * Nothing in here may be load-bearing for the decision the surrounding row is making: touch has
 * neither hover nor a focus ring, so the card never opens there. That is also why this wraps the
 * link rather than a help icon — the fallback has to be where the same tap already goes.
 *
 * Keyboard readers do get it: Base UI's preview card opens on focus-visible as well as hover, unlike
 * Radix's, whose docs warn it must not carry essential content for exactly that reason.
