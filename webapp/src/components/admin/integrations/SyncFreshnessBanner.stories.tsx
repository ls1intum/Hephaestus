/**
 * The section-wide freshness note.
 *
 * This surface exists to tell the truth about how fresh sync data is, which makes silence about its
 * own staleness its worst possible failure — and offline was exactly that silence. Query v5 defaults
 * to `networkMode: "online"`, so a dropped connection *pauses* queries instead of failing them:
 * nothing throws, no `QueryErrorAlert` fires, and a live progress bar simply freezes mid-run looking
 * exactly like a healthy one. The SSE banner doesn't cover it either — `EventSource` re-enters
 * CONNECTING rather than CLOSED on a network drop.
 *
 * Offline strictly outranks live-push-lost (a dead network makes the polling fallback moot), so it
 * replaces the note rather than stacking a second bar.
 *
 * Online state is read from `onlineManager` rather than `navigator.onLine` so the banner and the data
 * can never disagree — it's the same signal that decides whether queries run.
