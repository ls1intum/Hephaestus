 *   terminal hint would otherwise strand a "Running" job on screen forever. 30s bounds that
 *   staleness without competing with the sub-second freshness the hints already provide.
 * - **Healthy stream, idle →** no interval at all. Idle changes arrive via mutation invalidation
 *   (user-initiated) or a hint (scheduled jobs); a dropped idle hint is healed by the next window
 *   focus, which `staleTime: 30_000` keeps cheap.
 * - **`livePushUnavailable` →** polling *is* the freshness channel, so pay the full 5s/60s.
