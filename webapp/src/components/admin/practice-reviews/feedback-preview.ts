/**
 * The opening words of a piece of feedback, as a line of prose a row can be told apart by.
 *
 * `bodyPreview` is a fixed-character cut of the Markdown note the developer receives, so it usually
 * ends somewhere inside the first fenced code quote. Printed verbatim a row title reads as markup, a
 * language tag and half a statement. This flattens it to the sentence a person would read out: code
 * fences go entirely — a fragment of somebody's Java is never the useful summary of a note about
 * their Java — as do rules and list bullets, while inline markers are unwrapped so the words survive.
 *
 * The trailing ellipsis marks both cuts the text has been through, the server's and this function's.
 * Without it a preview that stops mid-clause reads as feedback that was itself truncated.
 *
 * Returns `undefined` for the two states with no prose to show: no body at all — conversation
 * feedback is recorded before anything is composed — and a preview that is nothing but a code quote.
 * They read differently to an operator, so the caller tells them apart on `bodyPreview` rather than
 * printing one sentence for both.
