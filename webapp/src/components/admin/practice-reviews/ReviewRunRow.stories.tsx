 * One row of the Reviews list: the work's title as the only link, the facts that place it, what the
 * review produced, and its status in a slot whose width is the same on every row of a list.

 * The tally is the part worth reading closely. A review that is still going and a review that
 * stopped early both have nothing to count, and neither gets a strip of zeroes — a strip means "this
 * finished and these are the numbers", so showing one for a run in flight would read as a finished
 * review that found nothing.
