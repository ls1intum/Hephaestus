/**
 * Outline stores a collection icon as ONE string that is either a named icon from its own registry,
 * a raw emoji character, or the UUID of a custom uploaded emoji. There is no type discriminator on
 * the wire and no endpoint that serves the named icons, so a consumer must classify the string the
 * same way Outline's client does: registry match wins, then UUID, then emoji as the fallback.
 *
 * Named icons resolve to the closest Lucide equivalent, tinted with the collection's Outline colour.
 * Anything unresolvable degrades to the colour dot — the raw identifier is never rendered as text.
