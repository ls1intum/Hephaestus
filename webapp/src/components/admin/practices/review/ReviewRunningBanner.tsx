 * The one thing worth saying above three tabs of settings: whether any of it is in force. It is a

 * boilerplate. Healthy is affirmed once, quietly green; only the states that stop reviews escalate to
 * warning, which is what keeps a tinted header meaning something when it appears. The icon and the
 * headline repeat what the tone says, so colour is never the only carrier (WCAG 2.2 SC 1.4.1).
 *
 * <p>This is the page's only answer to "are reviews running" and the only place model readiness is
 * stated: the settings below say how to change the model, never whether it is ready, so the two
 * cannot drift into contradicting each other.
 *
 * <p>`role="status"`, not `alert`: this is the standing state of the page rather than a response to
 * anything the reader just did, and an assertive announcement on every visit would interrupt them
 * mid-sentence.
