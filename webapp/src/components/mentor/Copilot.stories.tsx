Today you turn eight, our shining star,
With dreams that travel oh so far.
Like unicorns with silky manes,
Dancing through the rainbow lanes.

Your laughter sparkles, pure and true,
A magic only found in you.
Eight years of joy, eight years of light,
Making every day so bright.

So blow your candles, make a wish,
For all the dreams upon your list.
Our little unicorn so dear,
We celebrate another year!

Happy 8th Birthday! 🦄🌈`,
