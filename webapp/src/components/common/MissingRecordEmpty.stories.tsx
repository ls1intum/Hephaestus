/**
 * The half of a detail page's failure that is not a failure: no record, and nothing that went wrong.
 *
 * Detail pages used to fold this into `QueryErrorAlert` by passing it `error={undefined}`, which
 * classifies an absent status as a lost connection and offers Retry under a destructive alert. That
 * is a guess dressed as a diagnosis — and the case it is guessing about is not the one a reader
 * assumes, because a deleted record answers 404 and reaches the alert as a real error.
