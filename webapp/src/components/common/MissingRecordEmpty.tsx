 * The detail-page branch where there is no record *and* no error — which is not the same thing as a
 * record that is gone.
 *
 * A deleted record arrives as a 404, which is an error and reads as one: the generated query
 * functions pass `throwOnError: true` (`src/api/@tanstack/react-query.gen.ts`), so every status the
 * server answers with lands in `error`. What lands here instead is a query that is still pending
 * with nothing in flight — offline, where TanStack Query pauses the fetch rather than failing it, or
 * a fetch cancelled by navigating away and back.
 *
 * So this is deliberately not a `QueryErrorAlert`: that classifies by HTTP status, and an
 * absent status is read as a connection failure. Here there is no status to read, because nothing
 * ever answered. Saying so is more use than guessing at a cause.
