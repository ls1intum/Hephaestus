					Developers learn to work well in a team by doing the work and getting feedback on it. That
					feedback is a mentor's job, whether that is a coach on a university capstone or an
					experienced maintainer on an open-source project, and there is never enough of that
					attention to go round. The developers who need it most often get none. Hephaestus carries
					the routine part so that everyone gets some.
