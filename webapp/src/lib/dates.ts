 *
 * - An Invalid Date is still a `Date`, and `.toLocaleDateString()` on one renders the literal text
 *   "Invalid Date".
 * - A value that never passed through a generated response transformer — a hand-written fixture, a
 *   cache entry set directly — is still the ISO string its type calls a `Date`.
 *
 * Both degrade to `undefined` rather than to a fabricated `now`, leaving the caller its own fallback:
 * `asDate(value)?.toLocaleDateString() ?? "–"`.
