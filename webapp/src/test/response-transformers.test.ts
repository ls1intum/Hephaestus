/**
 * Guards the one setting that makes the generated `Date` types true: `transformer: true` on the
 * `@hey-api/sdk` plugin in `openapi-ts.config.ts`.
 *
 * The transformers plugin emits `transformers.gen.ts` whether or not anything consumes it, so
 * dropping that setting leaves a client that compiles, exports every hook and still types timestamps
 * as `Date` while handing components the raw ISO string. `typecheck` cannot see the difference. It
 * has shipped that way once, crashing a screen that formatted a timestamp.
 *
 * The assertions go through the real SDK rather than reading `sdk.gen.ts` as text, so they fail for
 * the reason that matters — a caller not getting a `Date` — however the wiring got lost. It lives
 * outside `src/api/` because `openapi-ts` empties that directory on every run.
