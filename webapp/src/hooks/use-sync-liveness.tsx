 * Whether the workspace SSE stream is down and the surface must fall back to polling.
 *
 * The integrations layout owns the one `useSyncEvents` stream for the whole section and publishes
 * its health here, so every page below can feed {@link syncPollInterval} without prop-drilling
 * through the generated query-options spreads.
 *
 * The default is `false` (healthy): a component rendered outside the layout — a story, a test
 * harness — has no stream to be told about, and assuming the degraded fast-poll there would invent
 * traffic nobody asked for.
