/**
 * Walks a reader back to the last page that exists once the result count says the one they asked for
 * does not. A page number lives in the URL, so it outlives the result set that made it reachable, and
 * neither the search parser nor the render can prevent that — the total only arrives with the
 * response.
 *
 * It corrects by navigating rather than by rendering a page the URL does not name, so the address
 * stays shareable and the correction survives a reload.
