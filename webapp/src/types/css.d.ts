// React's `CSSProperties` comes from csstype, which lists only standard properties, so a style
// object carrying a CSS custom property does not fit it. The template-literal index signature is
// narrow enough that a key which is neither a standard property nor a custom property is still
// rejected — an index signature of plain `string` would accept any key at all, so a misspelled
// property name would type-check and silently do nothing.
