 * When the expression runs, as far as the syntax can say.

 * - `render` — the nearest function is named as a component or a hook, so it runs on every render.
 *   That includes a parameter default, which is evaluated on entry like any other body expression.
 * - `elsewhere` — anything else, and the rule says nothing about it.
 *
 * `elsewhere` is where the honesty is. The nearest enclosing function is the only thing the AST can
 * establish; who calls that function it cannot. So an `onClick`, a `useEffect` body, a mutation
 * callback and a `useState(() => …)` initializer all land here — none of them is a render, and a rule
 * that reported them would be wrong about the majority of the readings in this tree. A lowercase
 * module-scope helper lands here too, along with a `useMemo` body and a `cell:` render prop, which
 * *are* render-time and are the price of not guessing.
