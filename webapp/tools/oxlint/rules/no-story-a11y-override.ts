/**
 * Every entry a story can reach the accessibility check through, by the object that holds it.

 *
 *     !globals.ghostStories && a11yParameter?.disable !== true &&
 *     a11yParameter?.test !== "off" && a11yGlobals?.manual !== true
 *
 * so `parameters.a11y` reconfigures the check, `globals.a11y` defers it and `globals.ghostStories`
 * skips it outright without naming accessibility at all. Any one of them alone takes a component out
 * of the suite. `ghostStories` is listed under `globals` only, because that is the only place the
 * addon reads it.
