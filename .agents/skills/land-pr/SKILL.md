# Land PR

## 1. See what changed

```bash
git status --short
git diff --name-only HEAD
```

Nothing staged or modified means nothing to land.

## 2. Know which CI legs your diff triggers

`detect-changes` in `.github/workflows/cicd.yml` holds the path filters; read it rather than
guessing. Two shapes surprise people: `docs/**`, `scripts/**` and the root lint, format and
tsconfig files select the `Tooling and Docs` leg, not the App Server leg; and `package.json` or
`pnpm-lock.yaml` select every source leg.

## 3. Format, then check

```bash
vp run format
vp run check
```

`check` is the complete local quality gate: every gate in the `quality` group in `vite.config.ts`,
and every one also runs in CI. CI additionally runs service tests, builds, images,
security checks, and workflow-specific gates. Formatting must never be the reason a remote build
fails.

## 4. Regenerate what your change invalidated

Generated artefacts are never hand-edited, and regeneration is destructive — it empties the target
directory first, so stash local edits.

```bash
vp run generate:api          # controllers or DTOs changed: rewrites openapi.yaml AND webapp/src/api
vp run db:draft-changelog    # entities changed (needs Docker); writes and wires the changelog, then prune it
vp run db:generate-erd-docs  # after pruning a changelog
```

`generate:api:specs` packages the reactor and boots the executable JAR on ports
it allocates itself, so nothing needs freeing; root `AGENTS.md` § Command caveats covers the
`HEPHAESTUS_APPLICATION_JAR` shortcut for a JAR you already built.

## 5. Run the tests your diff can break

```bash
vp run test:webapp
vp run test:server:unit
```

## 6. Re-run format + check

Regeneration produces unformatted output. Run step 3 again; both must be green on the final tree.

## 7. Changeset

A PR touching `server/`, `webapp/` or `docker/` needs a `.changeset/*.md` or `verify-changesets`
fails it.

```bash
vp exec changeset          # user-facing: pick the bump, write the summary in the operator's voice
vp exec changeset --empty  # no user-facing effect; say why in the body
```

`vp exec changeset` is interactive — with no TTY, hand-write `.changeset/<slug>.md`. The rules — voice,
bump, pre-1.0 `minor` with `**Operators:**` and a `.migration/<slug>.md` fragment, never
`MIGRATION.md` — are in `.changeset/README.md`. Touching `db/changelog/` without touching
`.changeset/` is always wrong.

## 8. Branch, commit, push

```bash
git branch --show-current    # if main, branch first
git checkout -b <type>/<description>
git add -A
git commit -m "<type>(<scope>): <description>"
git push -u origin HEAD
```

Types and scopes are enumerated in `commitlint.config.ts`, which is what validates the PR title —
read it there rather than from a copy. No `!` in the title; pre-1.0 breaking changes are carried by
the changeset, not the header.

## 9. Open the PR

```bash
PAGER=cat gh pr view --json number,url
```

If that reports that the current branch has no pull request, create it:

```bash
PAGER=cat gh pr create --base main --title "<type>(<scope>): <description>" --body "$(cat <<'BODY'
## What changed and why

<1-2 sentences: what and why>

## How to test

<manual steps, or "CI covers this">

## Release impact

<link the changeset and state operator action, or explain why neither applies>

## Notes for reviewers

<risks, tradeoffs, follow-up work, or delete this section>

## Visual evidence

<UI: before and after. Motion or timing: a short video. Otherwise delete this section.>

)"
```

## 10. Upload visual evidence

For a UI change, save PR-only evidence under the ignored `tmp/` directory and inspect it for
secrets, personal data, and unrelated content. Give each image alt text that describes the visible
state. For a video, describe the demonstrated behavior in the PR body.

```bash
mkdir -p tmp
gh pr edit --attach './tmp/before.png#Settings before the change' --attach './tmp/after.png#Settings after the change'
```

An upload can add earlier files before a later file fails. Inspect the PR before retrying, then
attach only the missing files.

## 11. Verify

```bash
PAGER=cat gh pr view --json url,title -q '"PR: \(.title)\nURL: \(.url)"'
```

Open the URL and check that every attachment renders, describes the intended state, and contains no
sensitive or unrelated content.
