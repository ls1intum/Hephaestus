# Fix CI

Diagnose every failing check in one pass, then push once. Fixing 2 of 5 failures burns a push cycle
and a full CI run.

## 1. Wait for the run to finish

```bash
PAGER=cat gh pr view --json number,statusCheckRollup --jq '{
  pr: .number,
  failed: [.statusCheckRollup[] | select(.conclusion == "FAILURE") | .name],
  pending: [.statusCheckRollup[] | select(.status == "IN_PROGRESS" or .status == "QUEUED") | .name]
}'
```

Anything pending means you do not yet know the failure set.

## 2. Read the job summaries before the logs

The `Quality` legs and the `App Server: Generated artifacts` job write a table to
`$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` naming the fixing command per failed check, and emit the same text as
`::error::` annotations. That table is the prescription. Logs are for what it cannot express — a
test assertion, a type error.

```bash
RUN_ID=$(PAGER=cat gh run list --branch "$(git branch --show-current)" --limit 1 \
  --json databaseId,conclusion --jq '[.[] | select(.conclusion == "failure")][0].databaseId')
PAGER=cat gh api "repos/{owner}/{repo}/actions/runs/$RUN_ID/jobs" \
  --jq '[.jobs[] | select(.conclusion == "failure" and (.name | test("CI Status|all-ci") | not)) | {id, name}]'
```

Then per failed job id:

```bash
PAGER=cat gh api "repos/{owner}/{repo}/actions/jobs/$JOB_ID/logs" 2>&1 | tail -80
```

Read every failure before changing anything.

## 3. Fix in dependency order

Formatting, then lint, then types, then behaviour — an earlier fix routinely erases a later failure.
Each leg's annotation names its own command; this table is only what the annotation cannot tell you.

| Failure | What it actually means |
|---|---|
| `routeTree.gen.ts is stale` | A Vite build writes it. `vp run build:webapp`, then commit the file. |
| `Brand assets are stale` | `Webapp: Stories` runs `export:assets` after `test:storybook`, so the job goes red after a clean pass line. Run `vp run --filter webapp export:assets` and commit `webapp/brand`, `webapp/public`, `docs/images/readme`, `docs/static/img` and `docker/compose.proxy.yaml`. |
| `App Server: Generated artifacts` | OpenAPI out of sync → `vp run generate:api`; schema drift → `vp run db:draft-changelog`; ERD outdated → `vp run db:generate-erd-docs`. |
| `Changelog immutability guard` (Security → `Dependencies, secrets, and policy`) | A changelog that reached `main` was edited, renamed or deleted, or a `master.xml` `<include>` was not appended at the end. Fix forward with a new changeset; never edit the released file. |
| `Verify changesets` | The PR touches shipped code with no `.changeset/*.md`. `/land-pr` step 7 has the rules. |
| `Tooling and Docs` red on a docs-only PR | Expected: `docs/**` is in the tooling path filter, where `docs:lint` and `gate:diagrams` run. |

## 4. Reproduce locally before pushing

```bash
vp run format
vp run check
```

`check` runs the `quality` group in `vite.config.ts`. CI additionally runs tests, builds, images
and the Docker-backed artifact gates; green `check` with red CI means one of those.

Server tiers: `vp run test:server:unit`, `vp run test:server:architecture`,
`vp run test:server:integration`; `server/AGENTS.md` § Build traps and § Test tiers have the rest.

## 5. Commit and push once

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "fix(<scope>): resolve ci failures"
git push
PAGER=cat gh pr checks --watch
```

If the same check fails twice with the same diagnosis, re-read the log rather than retrying the fix.
