/**
 * Pins the delivered-feedback ledger co-ownership seam (ADR 0021): {@code practices} owns the
 * {@code feedback} schema (entities + repositories), but the write-orchestration + transaction
 * boundary deliberately live in {@code agent} ({@code agent.handler.FeedbackLedgerRecorder} and the
 * reaction-aware delivery filters). The recorder cannot move into {@code practices} because it depends
 * on {@code agent.job.AgentJob} and {@code agent.handler.PracticeDetectionResultParser} — relocating it
 * would invert the dependency and close a {@code practices -> agent} Modulith cycle.
 *
 * <p><b>Why this matters.</b> The {@code feedback} package is an exposed {@code NamedInterface}, and
 * {@code agent} is an open module with no {@code allowedDependencies}, so today ANY module could legally
 * inject {@code FeedbackRepository} and write the ledger — Modulith verification would stay green. The
 * recorder's idempotency guard, REQUIRES_NEW best-effort transaction, and supersession invariant assume a
 * single write-orchestrator. This test makes that assumption load-bearing: only {@code agent} (the writer)
 * and {@code practices} (the owner) may depend on {@code practices.feedback}; the seam cannot silently
 * widen to a third module by accident.
