/**
 * The thread key decides supersede-vs-new on re-review: two deliveries that share a key edit one comment
 * in place; two that differ post a fresh one. So determinism (same destination → same key) and
 * collision-sensitivity (any destination axis change → a different key) are correctness, not cosmetics.
 * These cases lock the key's grain — {@code (artifact, recipient, surface)} — and pin a golden vector so
 * the wire identity can never drift silently. Mirrors {@code ObservationFingerprintTest}.
