/**
 * Re-offers signals whose review was refused by something an operator can undo.
 *
 * <p>Without this the ledger's unique constraint would be a trap: a signal refused because the
 * workspace was momentarily inactive, or its budget was spent, is recorded — and a recorded signal is
 * never acted on twice. The review would be lost permanently, and nothing upstream would ever notice
 * because the provider has no further transition to announce.
 *
 * <p>Whether a blocker has cleared is not observable from here — there is no event for "an admin
 * re-enabled practices" — so the sweep simply re-attempts on a human timescale and lets the
 * submission path answer.
