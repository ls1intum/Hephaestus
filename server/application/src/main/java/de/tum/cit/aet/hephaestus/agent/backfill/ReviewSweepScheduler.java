/**
 * Opens a campaign for every sweep schedule that has come due.
 *
 * <p>Every other way into the review path waits for an event, a reconciliation, a person asking, or an
 * admin scoping a campaign — so an artifact nothing ever announced would otherwise have no ledger row at
 * all, making "we never looked" indistinguishable from "we looked and declined". A workspace with a
 * schedule gets a row for every artifact in the window either way.
 *
 * <p>Deliberately thin: it selects due rows, hands each to {@link ReviewSweepCampaignOpener}, and logs.
 * The pacing, budget checks, cursor and per-artifact isolation belong to {@code ReviewBackfillDriver}.
 * Locked like {@code PendingSignalReaper} — two replicas opening the same due schedule would both
 * enumerate and price a scope before the campaign-under-way check settled it.
