/**
 * Who may ask for a review of a given artifact, right now.
 *
 * <p>Feedback is delivered to the artifact's author, not to whoever asked, so an unchecked request path
 * would let anyone who can reach the artifact aim coaching at a colleague. The requester must therefore
 * have standing — be the artifact's author or an assignee — or be a workspace admin; ordinary membership
 * alone is not enough. Shared by every front door onto a hand-requested review (SCM bot command, REST
 * endpoint) so the rule stays true in one place.
 *
 * <p>A Hephaestus account may link several SCM identities (ADR 0017), so standing is checked against a set
 * of identities. A bot command only knows the single identity that wrote the comment, so a multi-identity
 * admin fails closed there unless that identity is the admin one, and must use the REST front door instead.
