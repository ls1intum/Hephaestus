/**
 * Writes the IN_APP feedback units for one cycle's admitted messages.
 *
 * <p>{@code PREPARED} on write and {@code DELIVERED} on the recipient's first read (the compare-and-set
 * in {@code FeedbackRepository#markInAppDelivered}). We own this surface, so "delivered" can be an
 * observation instead of an assumption.
 *
 * <p>Because it can be observed, a card that has been read is never rewritten. A newer card about the
 * same habit replaces the one still waiting to be read — one live card per habit, not a pile — but if the
 * developer opened it first, the new card is written beside it and points back at it instead. That is
 * {@link de.tum.cit.aet.hephaestus.agent.handler.FeedbackSupersession}, and the swap happens inside this
 * method's transaction so a retirement can never outlive its replacement.
 *
 * <p>No {@code OutboundEgressGuard} check, deliberately, and unlike every other preparer here: that
 * guard is the last gate before an <em>external</em> write, and Silent Mode means Hephaestus stops
 * talking to third parties. The practice pages are our own surface and the recipient is the subject, so
 * gating it would turn a "do not post anywhere" switch into "stop recording what we found", which is a
 * different and much larger promise.
