/**
 * Compares what {@code WebhookPayloadSizeFilter} accepts against what the broker will actually take.
 *
 * <p>{@code max_payload} is a server-side NATS setting that defaults to 1 MB, an order of magnitude
 * below the 25 MiB the receiver accepts. Every delivery in the gap is verified, admitted, and then
 * refused by the broker at publish time, which the provider sees as a 503 — recoverable for the
 * events a provider retries, permanent for pushes, and invisible unless someone reads the publish
 * failure metric. The gap is a deployment fact the application cannot fix on its own, so it is read
 * from the live connection and reported rather than inferred from configuration.
