/**
 * A standing instruction to look at a workspace's recent work again on a cadence, whether or not anything
 * announced it. Every other way into the review path needs something to happen first, so without a
 * schedule an artifact nothing ever signalled is indistinguishable from one that was offered and
 * declined — both have no ledger row and no observation.
 *
 * <p><strong>A schedule says when, not whose.</strong> Do not add a repository or author list here:
 * {@code WorkspaceReviewScope.repositories} already defines the compute scope, and
 * {@code PracticeReviewDetectionGate} applies it to this path too. A second copy would disagree the first
 * time somebody changed one of them; recipient selection belongs to delivery policy instead.
 *
 * <p>Each tick opens a {@link ReviewBackfillRun} rather than driving artifacts itself, because the
 * campaign machinery already paces per tick, pauses on an exhausted budget, keeps a cursor and isolates
 * each artifact. The run is opened directly in {@code RUNNING}: creating this row is the confirmation.
