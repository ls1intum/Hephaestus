/**
 * Refuses agent image references that cannot name a build matching this server.
 *
 * <p>Unconditional, unlike {@link AgentImagePinGuard}: a digest is a production requirement, but a
 * <em>channel tag</em> — one that moves from build to build rather than naming one — is wrong in
 * every environment. It comes in two spellings, a name and a partial version, and both move. The
 * server stages its runners into whatever this resolves to, so an unmatched image is a runtime
 * contract violation that surfaces as a failing sandbox rather than as a configuration error.
 * See ADR 0031.
 *
 * <p>The reference is parsed rather than pattern-matched on its suffix. What arrives here is the
 * result of a substitution chain — a deploy substrate's {@code IMAGE_TAG}, Compose interpolation,
 * then Spring placeholder resolution — and every link in it can produce something that is neither a
 * channel tag nor a usable reference: an empty tag from an empty {@code APP_VERSION}, or no tag at
 * all. Both reach the daemon rather than this guard unless the tag is read out and judged.
