/**
 * Retires the message a newer one replaces, on the two lanes where "queued" and "read" are different
 * states.
 *
 * <p><b>The rule this exists to hold: nothing that has been received may be un-said.</b> A in-app card
 * or a mentor unit becomes DELIVERED at the moment the developer actually reads it, so replacing one that
 * has already flipped would rewrite something a person has in their head. The in-context lane is not this
 * act and does not come through here — there the comment is edited in place on the merge request, so
 * retiring the delivered row is what makes the ledger agree with what is now visible, and
 * {@link FeedbackLedgerRecorder} keeps doing it.
 *
 * <p><b>The caller must write the replacement in the same transaction as the claim.</b> This is one half
 * of a swap: on its own it takes a message out of somebody's queue and puts nothing back. The two must
 * commit or roll back together, or a lost write leaves the recipient with strictly less than they had.
