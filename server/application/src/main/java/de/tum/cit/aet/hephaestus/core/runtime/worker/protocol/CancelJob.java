 * Hub → worker frame requesting prompt cancellation of a specific running job (#1138).
 *
 * <p>Job-scoped (carries a {@code jobId}) so the owning worker — and only the owning worker — stops
 * its container. The authoritative {@code agent_job} status transition is performed by the hub
 * before dispatching this frame; the frame exists purely to stop the container promptly rather than
 * waiting for it to finish naturally. A worker that does not own the job ignores it.
 *
 * @param jobId the job UUID (string form)
 * @param reason short human-readable reason, for worker-side logging
