/**
 * Worst-first ordering for the measurements of one run, in the one place every stage that ranks them can
 * share it.
 *
 * <p><b>Why this exists at all.</b> Four stages used to carry their own copy of the same comparator, and
 * every copy tiebroke on detector-reported confidence, a field that did not discriminate observations and
 * has since been removed.
 * What replaces it has to be a property of the observation we can check rather than one it reports.
 *
 * <p><b>The keys, in order.</b>
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>Severity</b>, where it applies. A {@code GOOD} strength carries none (ADR 0022), and a null
 *       band sorts after every real one, so problems always precede strengths.</li>
 *   <li><b>Evidence breadth</b>, descending — {@link #evidenceBreadth(JsonNode)}, the number of distinct
 *       places the observation's citations point at. This is the in-run form of recurrence: a defect quoted at
 *       four loci is spreading through the change, and one quoted at a single locus is a one-off, which is
 *       the same reasoning the catalogue already applies when it tells a practice to weigh a copy "already
 *       spreading to several places" at the upper end of its band. It is observed rather than felt, it
 *       cannot be inflated by a model that wants its observation to lead, and it means the same thing for
 *       every practice in the catalogue — a security observation and a naming observation both get louder by
 *       being true in more of the work.</li>
 *   <li><b>A stable identity</b>, so the order is total and a re-run of the same job reproduces it exactly
 *       rather than flapping with the repository's iteration order. Persisted rows use their id;
 *       observations not yet stored use practice + title.</li>
 * </ol>
