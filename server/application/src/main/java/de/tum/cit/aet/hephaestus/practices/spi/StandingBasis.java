 * What a standing was read from, from the strongest basis to the weakest. A standing from current reviews rests on

 * result model: a recorded historical assessment, never current proof, read only where no current review reached the
 * practice. When a recorded outcome names no practice version, the criteria it was assessed against are unknown.
