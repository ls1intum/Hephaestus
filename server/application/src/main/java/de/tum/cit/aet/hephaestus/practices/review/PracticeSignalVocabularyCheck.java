 *
 * <p>Its own gated bean rather than a {@code @PostConstruct} on {@link PracticeSignalCoverage}: that
 * class is an ungated {@code @Service} because the trace views need it in every role, and a throw from
 * its construction would crash-loop the webhook pod, whose missed push events cannot be redelivered.
 * Same shape and reason as {@code IntegrationFrameworkBootstrap}.
