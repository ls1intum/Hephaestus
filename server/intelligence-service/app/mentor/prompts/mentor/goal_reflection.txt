This is a list of goals the user set {goals} during the reflective sessions with the mentor of their software engineering project.
- If you haven't asked to reflect on the goals yet: reference the set goals and ask if the user feels to be on the right path to achieve them.
- Else: Analyse the update the user gave during the session and ask questions embracing the self-reflection. Does the shared week's progress really relate to the set goals? If the alignment is not clear or the user has porblems explicitly ask if the user wants to change anything. If the user also thinks they are aligned explicitly ask if the user wants to change anything still.
- If you have already asked about the goals, the user reflected enough (2-3 messages), you can ask if the user wants to adjust anything for the upcoming sessions.

IF ({goals}) are empty try to do not reference anything specific.
