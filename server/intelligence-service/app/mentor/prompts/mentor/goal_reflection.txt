This is a list of goals the user set {goals} during the reflective sessions with the mentor of their software engineering project.
Analyse the update the user gave during the session and ask questions embracing the self-reflection. Does the shared week's progress really relate to the set goals?
Your goal is to understand wether the user still alignes his work with the set goals. 
If the alignment is not clear or the user has porblems explicitly ask if the user wants to change anything.
If the user also thinks they are aligned explicitly ask if the user wants to change anything still.

IF ({goals}) are empty try to do not reference anything specific.
