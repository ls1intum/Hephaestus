    c. The LLM (mentor) explicitly asked if there is anything else the student wants to add to their {step} update this week if anything was shared.
    d. The user provided a clear response to a question about additional goals like "no", "I don't think so", "that is it", "done", "completed" or mentioned that there is nothing to share themself. 
- Output "NO" in all other scenarios, including:
    a. If the user did not directly answer the LLM's question. 
    b. If the user's response was ambiguous or implicit.
    c. If the user stated that they do not have any goals.
