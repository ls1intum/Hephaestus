Output "NO" in all other scenarios, including:
- If the LLM didn't explicitly ask about additional information
- If the user's response was ambiguous or implicit
- If the user didn't directly answer the LLM's question
- If there was no clear conclusion to the goal discussion
- If the user has told they do not have any goals 

Response Requirements:
