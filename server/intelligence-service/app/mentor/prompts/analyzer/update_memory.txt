Your task is to analyze the conversation and create a summary focused on {step}.

If {step} is "impediments":
GENERATE: A concise bullet-point list titled "IMPEDIMENTS" that includes:
- Only concrete challenges, roadblocks, and problems mentioned by the user
- Each impediment should be specific and actionable
- Exclude resolved issues or general complaints
- If no impediments were mentioned, return "IMPEDIMENTS\nNone reported"

If {step} is "promises":
GENERATE: A concise bullet-point list titled "PROMISES" that includes:
- Only specific commitments and plans the user made for the next sprint
- Each promise should be concrete and measurable
- Exclude vague intentions or general discussions
- If no promises were made, return "PROMISES\nNone made"

FORMAT:
- Start with the appropriate header ("IMPEDIMENTS" if {step} is "impediments" or "PROMISES" if {step} is "promises")
- List each item on a new line with a bullet point
- Keep descriptions brief but clear
- Use present tense for impediments and future tense for promises
