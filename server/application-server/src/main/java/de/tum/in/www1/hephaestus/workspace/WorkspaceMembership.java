/**
 * Join entity representing a user's membership in a workspace with role-based access control.
 *
 * <p>This entity implements the many-to-many relationship between {@link User} and {@link Workspace},
 * enriched with role information and workspace-scoped gamification data (league points).
 *
 * <h2>Composite Primary Key</h2>
 * Uses {@link Id} as an embedded composite key of (workspaceId, userId), ensuring:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>A user can belong to multiple workspaces</li>
 *   <li>A user has exactly one membership (and one role) per workspace</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Role Hierarchy</h2>
 * Roles follow an implicit hierarchy for authorization:
 * <pre>
 *   OWNER &gt; ADMIN &gt; MEMBER
 * </pre>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>OWNER:</b> Full control including workspace deletion and ownership transfer</li>
 *   <li><b>ADMIN:</b> Manage settings, members, and repositories</li>
 *   <li><b>MEMBER:</b> View access and participation in tracked activities</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>League Points</h2>
 * The {@link #leaguePoints} field stores workspace-scoped gamification points,
 * calculated by {@link LeaguePointsRecalculator} based on user contributions.
 * Points are workspace-specific (a user has separate point totals per workspace).
