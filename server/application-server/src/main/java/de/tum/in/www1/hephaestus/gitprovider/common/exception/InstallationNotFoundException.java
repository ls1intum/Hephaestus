 * Exception thrown when a GitHub App installation is no longer accessible.
 * This typically occurs when:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>The installation was uninstalled by the user</li>
 *   <li>The installation was revoked</li>
 *   <li>The installation ID is stale/invalid</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>This is a non-retryable error - the installation will not become available
 * by retrying. The caller should abort the operation and clean up any cached state.
