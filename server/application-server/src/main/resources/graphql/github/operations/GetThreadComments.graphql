# GraphQL query for fetching paginated comments for a specific review thread
# Used to handle nested pagination when a thread has more than 100 comments
# Uses fullDatabaseId for comments (BigInt) since databaseId (Int) can overflow.
# User/Bot still use databaseId as fullDatabaseId is not available on Actor types.
# Note: Uses node(id:) approach as GitHub's GraphQL API doesn't expose reviewThread(id:) on pullRequest
