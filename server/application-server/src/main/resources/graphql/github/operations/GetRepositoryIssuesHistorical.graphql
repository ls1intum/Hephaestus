# GraphQL query for historical backfill of repository issues
# Uses CREATED_AT DESC ordering to fetch issues from newest to oldest
# This ensures most relevant data is synced first
#
# Why CREATED_AT DESC for backfill:
# 1. Most relevant first: Recent issues are more actionable
# 2. Stable ordering: Creation time doesn't change, so pagination is deterministic
# 3. Clear progress: highWaterMark = highest number, checkpoint counts down to #1
# 4. Incremental sync handles new items: Items created during backfill are caught by regular sync
