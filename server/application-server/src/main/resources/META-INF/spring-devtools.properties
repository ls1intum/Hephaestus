# Include hub4j GitHub API classes in the restart classloader.
# When DevTools restarts, the application classes are loaded by RestartClassLoader
# while third-party jars stay in the base classloader. This causes IllegalAccessError
# when our code (RestartClassLoader) tries to instantiate GHEventPayload subclasses
# that need to call the package-private GHEventPayload constructor (base classloader).
# By including github-api in the restart classloader, both classes share the same loader.
