 *
 * Measured, not guessed: asked to quote the title `Resolve "Connect data between screens"` verbatim,
 * gpt-oss-120b returned it with curly quotes in 6 of 6 runs across three different tool schemas. The
 * text was faithful; only the glyphs moved. Without this fold the citation fails `includes`, the
 * observation throws, and a correct measurement is lost — so the check was rejecting transcription rather
 * than fabrication, which is the opposite of its job.
 *
 * Deliberately narrow. Only characters with an unambiguous ASCII original are folded, so a quote that
 * says something the artifact does not still fails: this cannot turn a wrong quote into a right one.
