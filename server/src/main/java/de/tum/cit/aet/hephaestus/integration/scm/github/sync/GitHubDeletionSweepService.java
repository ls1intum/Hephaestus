/**
 * Deletion reconciliation for issues and pull requests — the half of "sync" that upserts cannot do.
 *
 * <p>Every other GitHub sync path is upsert-only, so an issue or pull request removed upstream
 * survives locally forever: it is caught only by a webhook, and this deployment's webhooks are not
 * redeliverable (ADR-0008), so a single missed delivery leaves a phantom row that permanently
 * inflates the per-repository counts the admin UI reports. For pull requests it is worse than
 * unreliable — GitHub has no {@code pull_request.deleted} action at all, so a pull request that
 * disappears (repository transfer, staff removal) has no event to miss and no code path to catch it.
 * This sweep is the only mechanism that closes either gap.
 *
 * <p>The method is a set difference. For each repository it enumerates the complete upstream number
 * set with a number-only GraphQL query ({@code GetRepositoryIssueNumbers} /
 * {@code GetRepositoryPullRequestNumbers}, ~1 rate-limit point per 100 items, versus ~59 for one
 * page of the content query), diffs it against the live local numbers, and tombstones the remainder.
 * It follows the {@code removeStale*} precedent already established for labels, milestones and
 * collaborators rather than inventing a second shape for the same idea.
 *
 * <h2>Fail-closed</h2>
 *
 * A sweep that deletes on bad data is far worse than the phantom row it exists to remove, because
 * the phantom is visible and a wrong deletion is not. So deletion is authorized by
 * <em>provable completeness</em> and nothing else: {@link UpstreamListing#complete()} is true only
 * when pagination ran to {@code hasNextPage == false} with no rate-limit abort, no GraphQL error, no
 * thrown exception, no page-cap truncation, no cancellation, and a node count that agrees exactly
 * with the server's own {@code totalCount}. Any doubt — including any doubt this code did not
 * anticipate, since the flag starts {@code false} and is set only on the one clean exit — skips the
 * repository entirely and deletes nothing. A partial listing is never merged with a previous one.
 *
 * <h3>An empty listing is not evidence of an empty repository</h3>
 *
 * The completeness proof above is a proof about <em>pagination</em>, and pagination is trivially
 * "complete" for a listing that returned nothing: {@code 0 == 0} satisfies the {@code totalCount}
 * cross-check exactly as well as {@code 4000 == 4000} does. That is the one shape where the strongest
 * check in this class has no discriminating power at all, and it authorizes tombstoning the whole
 * repository. Two further guards close it, both fail-closed:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>{@code featureDisabled}</b> — a repository whose Issues feature is switched off still answers
 *       the {@code issues} connection, with zero nodes and {@code totalCount: 0}. That is indexing
 *       state, not deletion: turning Issues back on returns every issue. The sweep selects
 *       {@code repository.hasIssuesEnabled} alongside the connection and refuses the listing when it is
 *       explicitly {@code false}. Pull requests have no equivalent toggle in GitHub's schema, so only
 *       the issue half carries a flag.
 *   <li><b>{@code emptyUpstreamWithLiveMirror}</b> — independently of any flag, a provably-complete but
 *       <em>empty</em> upstream listing is refused whenever the mirror still holds live rows of that
 *       class. The two readings of that combination are "every issue in the repository was deleted since
 *       the last sync" and "something about this listing is wrong (a narrowed token, an unannounced
 *       feature toggle, a vendor bug)". The first is rare and self-heals on the next sync; the second is
 *       not, and being wrong costs the whole repository. So the sweep declines and reports degraded
 *       rather than deleting on the least trustworthy evidence it can receive.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>The cost of both guards is bounded and known: a repository whose issues really were all deleted
 * keeps its phantom rows until a human notices. That is the deliberately cheaper failure.
 *
 * <p>Tombstone rather than row deletion: see {@code Issue#deletedAt}. Because
 * {@code IssueRepository.upsertCore} clears the tombstone, a repository wrongly swept heals itself on
 * the next ordinary sync — which is the property that makes acting on inference tolerable at all.
