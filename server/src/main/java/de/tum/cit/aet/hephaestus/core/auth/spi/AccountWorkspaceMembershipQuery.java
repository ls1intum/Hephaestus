 * Cross-module read query: which workspaces is the principal a member of, and with what role?

 * {@code Account → login} mapping (via {@code IdentityLink.usernameAtSignup}) and supplies the
 * resolved login set; the {@code workspace} module resolves {@code login → User → membership}
 * internally. This keeps the boundary clean: {@code core.auth} never imports workspace domain
 * types, and {@code workspace} never imports auth domain types — the contract lives here and is
 * implemented in {@code workspace} (dependency inversion, same shape as {@link AccountRoleQuery}).
