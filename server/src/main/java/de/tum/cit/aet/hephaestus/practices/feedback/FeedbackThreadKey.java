/**
 * Stable cross-run identity of a {@link Feedback} delivery <em>unit</em> (ADR 0021, F-16) — the join key
 * that lets a re-review SUPERSEDE the prior delivery and edit its comment in place instead of posting a
 * fresh one.
 *
 * <p><strong>Identity is the destination, NOT the content.</strong> The unit is keyed by <em>where it is
 * delivered</em>: the artifact {@code (artifact_kind, artifact_id)}, the {@code recipient}, and the
 * {@code surface}. Two reviews of the same PR deliver the same in-context summary unit to the same author →
 * same continuity key → the second supersedes the first. The observations it references are the changing
 * <em>content</em>, recorded separately, so the unit's identity is stable even as its body churns between
 * reviews.
 *
 * <p><strong>What "the destination" means differs by lane, and that difference is the design.</strong> An
 * in-context note is delivered <em>onto a piece of work</em>, so the artifact is where it lands and
 * {@link #compute} keys on it. The two longitudinal lanes land on nothing — a in-app card and a
 * mentor turn are about a <em>habit</em> observed across several pieces of work — so their destination is
 * the practice, and {@link #forPractice} keys on that instead. A second card about the same habit
 * replaces the first rather than stacking beside it; a second card about a different habit is a different
 * thread even though both land on the same page.
 *
 * <p>One computation for all three lanes, deliberately. The key is only useful because "find the queued
 * message I would replace" is a lookup on an indexed column, and two vocabularies in one indexed column
 * make that lookup unwritable.
 *
 * <p>Locale-safe (Locale.ROOT) lower-cased SHA-256 hex, 64 chars, matching {@code feedback.thread_key
 * VARCHAR(64)}. Pure and side-effect free.
