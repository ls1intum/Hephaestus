 * {@code scm.pull_request.reviewed} is raised by a GitHub review event and by GitLab merge-request and
 * note events. Keys are repeated from the handlers on purpose — the bootstrap resolves each against the
 * handler registry, so a drift here fails the boot instead of quietly declaring undeliverable provenance.
