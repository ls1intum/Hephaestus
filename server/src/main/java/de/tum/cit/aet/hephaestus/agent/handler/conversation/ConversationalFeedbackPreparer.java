/**
 * Writes the PREPARED IN_CHAT feedback units for a cycle's admitted observations. A prepared unit is a
 * standing "raise this next" marker: {@code channel=IN_CHAT}, {@code deliveryState=PREPARED}, and a body that
 * is either the composer's <em>move</em> or nothing at all. Each unit's recipient is its own observation's
 * {@code about_user_id} (per-observation).
 *
 * <p><b>Two selections, and which one runs is the composer's to decide.</b> When the composition stage wrote
 * anything for this lane, its units <em>are</em> the decision about what is worth raising: each one names a
 * practice, the server resolves that practice's admitted loci itself, and the best-ranked locus per recipient
 * carries the unit. A locus the composer wrote nothing about is not raised — the stage read it and chose not to
 * speak, which is a property of the evidence and not a withholding this server owes anybody a row for. When the
 * stage produced nothing for this lane (it is a stage a review may skip, and it may fail), selection falls back to
 * the severity ranking below, and the body stays NULL exactly as before, so that the mentor composes at delivery
 * as it always has.
 *
 * <p><b>What is frozen, and what is not.</b> The stored brief is the opener, the evidence to hold back, and the
 * target - never the mentor's script. That is a real narrowing of the old NULL-body rule, taken deliberately: the
 * mentor still writes every word of the turn with the live conversation in front of it, and the 14-day TTL sweep
 * still expires a move that was never raised. See {@link ConversationBriefBody}.
 *
 * <p><b>One live move per habit.</b> Every raised unit carries a {@code threadKey} scoped to its practice, so a
 * later move about the same habit replaces the one still queued rather than stacking beside it. A move the mentor
 * has already raised is DELIVERED and is never rewritten; the replacement is written beside it and points back at
 * it instead. That swap is {@link de.tum.cit.aet.hephaestus.agent.handler.FeedbackSupersession}, and it happens
 * inside this method's transaction so a retirement can never outlive its replacement. The key is also what the
 * composer is shown as a supersession target, so a unit written without one can never be replaced by anything.
 *
 * <p>Bounded (top-N=3 raised per recipient). Ordinals are derived from the admitted observations alone, in a
 * deterministic order (recipient, then {@link FindingOrder}: severity, evidence breadth, id), so a re-run of the
 * same job re-derives the same {@code (agent_job_id, position)} grain whatever the composer said, and the {@code existsByAgentJobIdAndPosition}
 * guard makes preparation idempotent. Positions start at
 * {@link FeedbackLedgerRecorder#IN_CHAT_UNIT_ORDINAL_BASE} so they never collide with the IN_CONTEXT /
 * suppressed / policy-floor units of the same job.
