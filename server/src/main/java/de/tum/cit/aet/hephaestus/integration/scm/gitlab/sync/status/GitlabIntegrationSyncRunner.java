     * cooldown only to the scheduler's 60s tick, not to a pass a job owns: that cooldown is tick-spacing,
     * and the administrator who clicked the button is the pacing signal. Error backoff still applies to
     * everybody, and rate limiting is enforced inside the sync services regardless of caller, so a manual
     * run cannot outrun the vendor.
     *
     * <p>The no-progress warning is therefore raised only when <em>nothing</em> advanced across the whole
     * job, not merely on the pass that ends the loop: a backfill that moved two repositories and then hit
     * the cooldown is a clean success, and reporting it as SUCCEEDED_WITH_WARNINGS would be the same
     * misreading in the opposite direction.
