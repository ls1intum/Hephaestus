/**
 * The destination-class axis of a {@link Feedback} unit: <em>where</em> it lands, decoupled from <em>what we say</em>,
 * so the same synthesised unit can be routed to different rendering surfaces.
 *
 * <p>Every channel is <b>developer-facing</b>: a unit is delivered to its recipient developer
 * ({@link Feedback#getRecipientUserId()}), never to a mentor, instructor, or grader. The system has no
 * facilitator/evaluative delivery channel.
 *
 * <p><b>All three names sit on one axis: where the unit lands.</b> Not what the developer is supposed to
 * do with it, not what cognitive level it addresses. The one question a reader raises here is that the
 * mentor also renders inside the app, so read the two private values this way:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #IN_CHAT} is the <b>dialogic</b> channel — a turn in a conversation, wherever that
 *       conversation runs: the in-app mentor at {@code /w/:slug/mentor}, or Slack. The surface it renders
 *       on is not what makes it {@code IN_CHAT}; being a turn is.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #IN_APP} is the <b>non-dialogic</b> practice surface — the developer's own practice pages.
 *       Nobody replies to it.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Ask <em>is it a turn?</em> before <em>which screen?</em>, and the two never overlap.
 *
 * <p>Constrained at the DB by {@code chk_feedback_channel}. The three values happen to line up with the
 * task, self-regulation and process levels of Hattie &amp; Timperley's model (ADR 0029), but they are not
 * named for it: a channel is a destination, and a level is a claim about content that the destination
 * does not enforce.
 *
 * <p><b>{@code IN_APP} has been renamed three times; this is the last one.</b> It was
 * {@code REFLECTION_DASHBOARD} (dropped for naming a page), then {@code PROFILE} (dropped for colliding
 * with the public user profile), then {@code REFLECTION} — dropped because it named what the developer is
 * supposed to <em>do</em> rather than where the feedback lands, because it asserted an outcome the system
 * cannot observe (nothing here can tell whether anyone reflected), and because two Java packages named
 * {@code reflection} collide with {@code java.lang.reflect} in every reader's head. A future value goes on
 * this same axis or not at all.
 *
 * <p>This is the destination a delivery is recorded against, not the thing that does the delivering:
 * the vendor pipes are {@code integration.core.spi.SummaryChannel}, {@code InlineFindingChannel} and
 * {@code ApprovalChannel}, each named for what it posts. Both in-context lanes collapse to
 * {@link #IN_CONTEXT} here, because the ledger records that the developer was told in place while the
 * delivery path still has to know which bean to call.
