/**
 * GitLab integration manifest. {@code GitlabWebhookSignatureVerifier} runs dual-mode
 * (legacy plaintext {@code X-Gitlab-Token} + GitLab 19.0+ HMAC {@code whsec_*}).
 *
 * <p>Feedback-delivery / inline-finding / approval capabilities are gated on the
 * {@code hephaestus.integration.gitlab.enabled} flag — the underlying GraphQL provider and the
 * channel beans share that flag, and the bootstrap demands matching SPI beans for any
 * declared capability. GitLab is opt-in (default off), so the manifest reports {@link #enabled()}
 * from that flag and the bootstrap skips the bean checks when it is off. The manifest bean itself is
 * registered either way: what GitLab <em>could</em> raise is a fact about the build, and a workspace
 * has to be able to read it in order to be told that connecting GitLab would wake a dormant practice.
 *
 * <p>No {@code RATE_LIMITED}: GitLab has no per-kind {@code RateLimitTracker} impl.
 * No {@code SCOPE_CHANGES}: GitLab has no install/uninstall/scope webhooks, so
 * {@code GitlabLifecycleListener.onScopeChanged} would never fire — declaring the
 * capability would lie to the UI's practice-gating check.

     * GitLab carries the same shared domain as GitHub minus one signal, and that omission is the reason
     * this declaration exists.
     *
     * <p>{@code scm.pull_request.synchronized} is absent because GitLab's webhook path emits no
     * synchronize event at all — a merge-request hook fires on a push, but the processor derives no
     * "new commits" transition from it. So a practice watching for new commits has never fired on
     * GitLab, and there was no way to tell that apart from a quiet week. Declared here, it becomes a
     * dormant binding with a reason instead of silence, and the day the processor learns to diff head
     * commits, this set grows by one line and every such practice wakes up.
     *
     * <p>Delivery lanes are gated on the same flag as the channel beans: claiming a lane whose
     * {@code SummaryChannel} is not wired would be caught at boot, which is the intended behaviour but
     * a poor way to find out.
