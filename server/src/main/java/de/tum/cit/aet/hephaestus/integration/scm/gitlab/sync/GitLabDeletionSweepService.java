/**
 * Deletion reconciliation for GitLab issues and merge requests — the half of "sync" that upserts
 * cannot do. The GitLab counterpart of {@code GitHubDeletionSweepService}, reusing the same shared,
 * integration-agnostic tombstone infrastructure ({@code Issue#deletedAt},
 * {@code IssueRepository#tombstone{Issues,PullRequests}ByRepositoryIdAndNumbers}).
 *
 * <p>Every GitLab sync path is upsert-only, so an issue or merge request removed upstream survives
 * locally forever. It is worse than for GitHub: GitLab emits <em>no issue- or merge-request-deletion
 * webhook at all</em>, so there is not even a missed event to blame — a deleted issue or MR simply has
 * no code path that would ever notice it, and its phantom row permanently inflates the per-project
 * counts the admin UI reports and keeps feeding practice-detection and mentor context as if it were
 * live. This sweep is the only mechanism that closes the gap.
 *
 * <p>The method is a set difference. For each project it enumerates the complete upstream IID set with
 * a number-only GraphQL query ({@code GetProjectIssueNumbers} / {@code GetProjectMergeRequestNumbers},
 * a fraction of the complexity of the content queries), diffs it against the live local numbers
 * (GitLab stores each issue/MR under the repository keyed by its per-project {@code iid}, which is the
 * {@code Issue.number} the mirror persists), and tombstones the remainder. It follows the
 * {@code removeStale*} precedent already established for repositories, labels and milestones rather
 * than inventing a second shape for the same idea.
 *
 * <h2>Fail-closed</h2>
 *
 * A sweep that deletes on bad data is far worse than the phantom row it exists to remove, because the
 * phantom is visible and self-correcting and a wrong deletion is not. So deletion is authorized by
 * <em>provable completeness</em> and nothing else: {@link UpstreamListing#complete()} is true only
 * when pagination ran to {@code hasNextPage == false} with no rate-limit abort, no GraphQL error, no
 * circuit-breaker rejection, no thrown exception, no unparseable IID, no page-cap truncation, no
 * cancellation, a {@code count} that was actually observed, and an IID count that agrees exactly with
 * that {@code count}. Any doubt — including a doubt this code did not anticipate, since the flag
 * starts {@code false} and is set only on the one clean exit — skips the entity class entirely and
 * deletes nothing. A partial listing is never merged with a previous one.
 *
 * <h3>An empty listing is not evidence of an empty project</h3>
 *
 * The completeness proof above is a proof about <em>pagination</em>, and pagination is trivially
 * "complete" for a listing that returned nothing: {@code 0 == 0} satisfies the count cross-check
 * exactly as well as {@code 4000 == 4000} does. That is the one shape where the strongest check in
 * this class has no discriminating power at all, and it authorizes tombstoning the entire project.
 * Two further guards close it, both fail-closed:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>{@code featureDisabled}</b> — GitLab's {@code IssuesFinder} silently scopes out projects
 *       whose Issues feature is switched off ({@code .merge(Project.with_issues_enabled)}), and the
 *       merge-request finder behaves the same way. Turning the feature off therefore does not raise an
 *       error; it renders as a perfectly well-formed, perfectly "complete" listing of zero items.
 *       The sweep now selects {@code project.issuesEnabled} / {@code project.mergeRequestsEnabled}
 *       alongside the connection and refuses the listing whenever the relevant flag is explicitly
 *       {@code false}. A toggled-off feature hides upstream data; it does not delete it.
 *   <li><b>{@code emptyUpstreamWithLiveMirror}</b> — independently of any flag, a provably-complete but
 *       <em>empty</em> upstream listing is refused whenever the mirror still holds live rows of that
 *       class. The two readings of that combination are "every issue in the project was deleted since
 *       the last sync" and "something about this listing is wrong (permission scope-out, a feature flag
 *       GitLab has not told us about, a vendor bug)". The first is rare and self-heals on the next
 *       sync; the second is not, and being wrong costs the whole project. So the sweep declines and
 *       reports degraded rather than deleting on the least trustworthy evidence it can receive.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>The cost of both guards is bounded and known: a project whose issues really were all deleted keeps
 * its phantom rows until a human notices. That is the cheaper failure.
 *
 * <p>Tombstone rather than row deletion: see {@code Issue#deletedAt}. Because
 * {@code IssueRepository.upsertCore} / {@code PullRequestRepository.upsertCore} clear the tombstone
 * ({@code deleted_at = NULL}), a project wrongly swept heals itself on the next ordinary sync — the
 * property that makes acting on inference tolerable at all.
