/**
 * How every locus in a window of one person's measurements moved, as set arithmetic over recurrence keys.
 *
 * <p>This is the bookkeeping half of the measurement/intervention split: the composition stage does all
 * the writing, and this does the counting, because a set difference over hashes is what code is good at
 * and a model is bad at — and getting it wrong produces the worst artefact the system can emit, "the gap
 * from last week is closed" when it is not.
 *
 * <p><b>{@link Status#RESOLVED} is the reason this exists.</b> A locus that was a problem and is absent
 * from the newest review of its artifact originates from no current measurement at all, so a mapping that
 * walks this run's observations can never reach it. It is feedback with nothing to map from.
 *
 * <p>Pure and side-effect free: it takes a flat list of loci and returns the classification. Nothing here
 * reads a repository, a clock or a file, so every rule below is a unit test with no database in it.
 *
 * <p><b>The comparison is per artifact, and that is forced by the key, not chosen.</b>
 * {@link ObservationFingerprint} folds {@code artifactId} into the digest, so the same practice failing on
 * two different merge requests carries two different recurrence keys and can never be compared as one
 * locus. "This keeps happening across your work" is therefore a claim about a <em>practice</em> over the
 * window — which the staged observation history already carries — and not a claim this class can make.
 * What it does say is what happened at each locus between the runs that looked at it.
