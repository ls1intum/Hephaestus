/**
 * The settled chat thread as a reviewable artifact.
 *
 * <p>Unconditional on purpose, unlike {@code SlackManifest}: a descriptor is the domain's ceiling — what
 * the kind <em>is</em> — while a manifest is one vendor's contribution to it. Gating this on Slack being
 * enabled would make the three shipped conversation practices unauthorable, and then unloadable, on
 * every instance that has not connected Slack.
 *
 * <p>Its single signal has no {@code producedBy}, which is the honest declaration: no ingested event
 * says a discussion has finished. {@code ConversationThreadTriggerScheduler} decides it from quiescence,
 * depth and growth, and the contract has no way to name a scheduler as a producer — an empty set says
 * "raised from somewhere other than ingestion", which is exactly true.
