/**
 * Transport-neutral sink for exactly <em>one</em> mentor turn. One instance == one turn; never reuse
 * across turns. {@link MentorChatService} drives the whole turn through this interface and must not
 * branch on the concrete transport.
 *
 * <p>Implementations:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link MentorSseChannel} — the webapp surface over an HTTP {@code text/event-stream}.</li>
 *   <li>(future) a Slack DM adapter that renders {@link UIMessageChunk}s to the Slack streaming API
 *       inside an Assistant thread — see {@code .ai/notes/slack-integration-design.md} (D5/D6).</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>Contract every implementation must honour</h3>
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>Write serialization.</b> {@link #send} is invoked from both the turn thread and the Pi
 *       event-callback thread. Implementations MUST serialize writes internally; callers never
 *       synchronize.</li>
 *   <li><b>Post-terminal no-op.</b> After any {@code completeWith*} or {@link #close()}, every method
 *       is a silent no-op. A stray late {@link #send} (e.g. a runner emitting a second terminal
 *       event) must not be mistaken for a client disconnect.</li>
 *   <li><b>Idempotent terminals.</b> All {@code completeWith*} methods and {@link #close()} are
 *       idempotent and never throw.</li>
