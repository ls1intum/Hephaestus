/**
 * Immutable record of one concrete placement of a synthesized {@code Feedback} unit on a
 * delivery surface — a summary block, an inline diff anchor, or a conversation turn.
 *
 * <p>A single feedback unit can have multiple placements (1:N): for example a SUMMARY block
 * plus several INLINE anchors. Each placement carries the diff-anchor coordinates (path, line,
 * side) and the external comment/note id so re-delivery can be reconciled per anchor.
 *
 * <p>Append-only / {@code @Immutable}: posting outcomes that change over time are represented by
 * writing a new placement row rather than mutating an existing one through the ORM. The parent
 * {@link Feedback} lives in the same {@code practices.feedback} module, so a real
 * {@code @ManyToOne} association is used with DB-level {@code ON DELETE CASCADE} — no scalar-FK
 * cycle workaround is needed. This is the WADM <em>selector</em> edge (where a body of commentary
 * is anchored), orthogonal to the {@link FeedbackObservation} <em>target</em> edge.
 *
 * <p>The diff-anchor columns are a coupled group (changelog {@code 1781092589259}): they are populated
 * only for {@code INLINE} placements, so all are nullable and NULL means "this surface carries no diff
 * coordinate" (the normal case for {@code SUMMARY} / {@code CONVERSATION_TURN}). The enum columns are
 * value-constrained by {@code chk_feedback_placement_placement} (NOT NULL) and the NULL-tolerant
 * {@code chk_feedback_placement_anchor_kind} / {@code chk_feedback_placement_anchor_side}. Two indexes
 * exist: {@code idx_feedback_placement_feedback} (a unit's placements + the FK {@code ON DELETE CASCADE})
 * and {@code idx_feedback_placement_external_ref} (reconcile a posted comment id back to its placement).
 *
 * @see Feedback for the feedback unit being placed
 * @see PlacementType for SUMMARY/INLINE/CONVERSATION_TURN
