/**
 * The body-free view of a mirrored {@link OutlineDocument} the reconcile diffs against.
 *
 * <p>This exists for one reason: {@code bodyMarkdown} is an unbounded eagerly-fetched {@code text}
 * column (the build has no bytecode enhancement, so {@code @Basic(LAZY)} would be silently ignored),
 * and the per-workspace mirror is capped at hundreds of megabytes. Loading the whole mirror as entities
 * to diff it would materialize every Markdown body as a UTF-16 {@code String} plus Hibernate's
 * dirty-check snapshot of it — a multi-hundred-megabyte spike in the application-server JVM on every
 * six-hourly reconcile, next to the mentor.
 *
 * <p>The diff never needs a body: it decides on {@code outlineUpdatedAt} + {@code contentHash} (the
 * unchanged fast path), {@code deletedAt} (revive vs. tombstone), and mere body <em>presence</em> (the
 * archived-document backfill). Only rows that are actually written are re-read as full entities, inside
 * the short write transaction that mutates them.
 *
 * @param bodyLength length of the mirrored body in characters, or {@code null} when there is no body
 *                   (never exported, size-cap evicted, or tombstoned) — see {@link #hasBody()}
