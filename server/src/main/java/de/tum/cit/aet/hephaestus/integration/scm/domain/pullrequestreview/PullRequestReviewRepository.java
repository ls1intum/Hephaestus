 * Provider-domain lookups (by native ID + provider ID, by pull-request ID) run during
 * sync flows; workspace context is established by the caller.

     * signal, and counting orphans of a deleted PR would leave this row permanently inflated. The
     * predicate rides the {@code r.pullRequest} join the grouping already needs.
