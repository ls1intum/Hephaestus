/**
 * The mirror's erasure half: the operations that <em>remove</em> mirrored content, as opposed to the
 * enumerate-and-upsert half that {@link OutlineDocumentSyncService} performs.
 *
 * <p>Removal is a different concern from ingestion and carries different risk. An upsert that goes wrong
 * is corrected by the next pass; a body or an author field dropped here is gone — the mirror is the only
 * copy Hephaestus holds, and Outline offers no way to ask for it back once the upstream document is
 * really deleted. Keeping the three erasure paths together makes that risk one readable surface instead
 * of three clauses buried in a thousand-line reconcile:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #tombstone} — an upstream deletion: drop the body, its hash and every person-bearing
 *       field, keeping only the structural marker;</li>
 *   <li>{@link #tombstoneVanished} — deletion <em>inferred</em> from absence in an enumeration;</li>
 *   <li>{@link #enforceSizeCap} — capacity eviction, which drops bodies but keeps the rows and their
 *       hashes so the next reconcile can tell "evicted" from "changed".</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>This class does not decide when to erase.</b> The fail-closed rules live with the enumeration
 * that alone can know whether it was complete: {@link #tombstoneVanished} deletes exactly what its
 * caller's {@code seen} set says is gone, so a caller must pass a set from a full, uncancelled,
 * un-rate-limited enumeration on a {@link de.tum.cit.aet.hephaestus.integration.core.sync.SyncJobType#RECONCILIATION}
 * pass, and must not call it at all otherwise. Nothing here is transactional; each write is its own short
 * {@code REQUIRES_NEW} unit via {@link OutlineMirrorWriter}, matching the sync service's connection
 * discipline.
 *
 * <p>The event log ({@code outline_document_event}) is deliberately out of scope for every path here: it
 * is the audit trail and erases with the workspace/connection, not with a document.
