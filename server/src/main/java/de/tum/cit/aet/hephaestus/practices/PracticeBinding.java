/**
 * The occasion on which a practice is reviewed, and the evidence that review needs.
 *
 * <p>A practice declares exactly one of these — {@code PracticeDefinitionValidator} refuses a second.
 * One occasion may name several signals, which is how a practice judged all the way along a piece of
 * work is written; a practice that must read <em>different</em> evidence at a different moment is a
 * second practice, which is what the shipped catalogue does and what keeps one row, one tier setting
 * and one feedback history describing one habit.
 *
 * <p>The evidence therefore travels with the occasion rather than being named once and shared across
 * practices: shared evidence made adding a source to one practice a mutation invisible in that
 * practice's diff. The list shape survives the single-occasion rule so that relaxing the rule stays a
 * validator change rather than a data migration.
 *
 * @param signals  the signals that occasion this review; at least one, and all of one artifact kind
 * @param onDrafts whether a draft artifact occasions this review; defaults to false since most
 *                 practices judge work that has been handed over
 * @param subject  whose conduct a review occasioned this way judges. Defaults to {@link ActorRole#AUTHOR},
 *                 which is what almost every practice is about; a practice about reviewing names
 *                 {@link ActorRole#REVIEWER}. Declared on the occasion rather than on the signal because
 *                 one signal occasions both kinds: {@code scm.pull_request.reviewed} starts
 *                 {@code engaging-with-inline-review-comments} (about the author) and
 *                 {@code leaves-useful-specific-review-comments} (about the reviewer) in the same run.
