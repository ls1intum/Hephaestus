/**
 * Service Provider Interface for sandboxed container execution.
 *
 * <p>The job execution pipeline ({@code AgentJobExecutor}) codes against this interface. The
 * default implementation ({@code DockerSandboxAdapter}) manages containers on the local Docker
 * daemon. A future {@code RemoteRunnerAdapter} can delegate to runner agents on separate nodes via
 * NATS — same interface, different implementation, zero pipeline changes.
 *
 * <p>The {@link #execute} method blocks until the container completes, times out, or is cancelled.
 * Callers are expected to invoke it on a dedicated executor (e.g. {@code sandboxExecutor}) — never
 * on the main thread or virtual threads.
 *
 * <h2>Concurrency</h2>
 *
 * <p>Implementations must be thread-safe. Multiple jobs may execute concurrently on different
 * threads. Cancellation via {@link #cancel} may be called from any thread.
 *
 * <h2>Lifecycle</h2>
 *
 * <p>Each call to {@link #execute} is self-contained: it creates all resources (network, container,
 * files), runs the container, collects output, and cleans up. Orphaned resources from crashes are
 * handled by {@code SandboxReconciler}.
