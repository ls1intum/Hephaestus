/**
 * Architecture rules pinning the placement of {@link Transactional @Transactional} on every
 * {@code *AspectProvider} in {@code ..agent.context.providers.mentor..} (matched by name pattern,
 * so the rule cannot drift as providers are added).
 *
 * <p><b>The bug shape this guards against:</b> Spring AOP intercepts {@code @Transactional} via
 * the bean proxy. A class's own {@code this.method(...)} call bypasses the proxy entirely, so an
 * annotation on a helper that is only ever invoked through a self-call is silently dropped
 * (Spring docs: <i>"Calling a method on the proxy from within the target object will not be
 * intercepted"</i>). Combined with {@code spring.jpa.open-in-view=false}, the annotation looks
 * load-bearing in the code but actually does nothing.
 *
 * <p>{@code @Transactional(readOnly = true)} therefore belongs on {@code contribute(...)} — the
 * external entry point {@code WorkspaceContextBuilder} calls through the proxy — never on the
 * helper {@code buildPayload(...)}. These rules pin that placement so a refactor that moves the
 * annotation onto the helper fails at architecture-test time instead of at runtime via
 * {@code LazyInitializationException} on the SSE wire.
