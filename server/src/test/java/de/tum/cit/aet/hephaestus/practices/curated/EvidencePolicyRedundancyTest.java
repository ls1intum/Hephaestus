     * about what a practice may assert, made here rather than noticed in a diff.
     *
     * <p>Two different claims land a practice on this list, and both are absences.
     *
     * <p>The first four assert a <em>gap</em> over a corpus that arrives in pages: "no reviewer raised this",
     * "the issue closed with its outcome unmet". A partial capture of review threads is equally consistent
     * with "nobody raised it" and "the raising was in the part we did not fetch", so the whole capture is
     * what makes the gap assertable at all.
     *
     * <p>The eight defect detectors are here for the mirror-image reason: to assert a <em>clean</em> result.
     * Their target signal is the undesirable behaviour, so their strength has the shape "the defect could have
     * appeared in this change and did not" — a universal over the corpus, admissible only where the corpus is
     * closed and was covered whole. Each was already scoped to the added and changed lines of the diff, and
     * {@code scm.pull-request.diff} is a source the contract can only report {@code COMPLETE} (it does not
     * support {@code PARTIAL}) and already demands {@code COMPLETE_AND_NON_EMPTY}, so holding it
     * {@code EXHAUSTIVE} costs no readiness and buys the verdict. Without it these practices had to answer a
     * clean surface with {@code NOT_APPLICABLE} — "this work had no subject for this practice" — which is
     * false of a change they read, and which reads to a developer as "you touched nothing relevant".
