# Coding and Design Guidelines

These guidelines are intended to help maintain a consistent coding style and architectural design across the Hephaestus codebase. We distinguish between these main areas:

```{toctree}

:maxdepth: 1

performance
server
client
database
```


## Overview

This document provides an overview of the coding and design guidelines for the Hephaestus project. For detailed guidelines on specific areas, please refer to the linked documents above.

### Purpose

The purpose of these guidelines is to:

1. Ensure consistency across the codebase
2. Improve code quality and maintainability
3. Facilitate collaboration between team members
4. Reduce the learning curve for new developers
5. Optimize performance and user experience

### How to Use These Guidelines

These guidelines should be used as a reference when developing new features or modifying existing code. They are not meant to be strict rules but rather best practices that should be followed whenever possible.

If you find that a guideline is not applicable in a specific situation, you can deviate from it, but you should document the reason for doing so in the code or in the pull request description.

### Contributing to the Guidelines

These guidelines are not set in stone and can be improved over time. If you have suggestions for improving the guidelines, please open a pull request with your proposed changes.

When proposing changes to the guidelines, please consider the following:

1. The impact on existing code
2. The benefits of the proposed change
3. The ease of adoption
4. The alignment with industry best practices
