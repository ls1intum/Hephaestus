# ADR 0042: Hosts pull their own releases

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-09-03
**Builds on:** [ADR 0034](0034-signed-release-image-lock.md), whose release evidence and image-lock
decisions are unchanged; replaces the SSH push in `deploy-locked-compose.yml`.

## Context

Deployments pushed from CI over SSH through a jump host. That path put two long-lived private keys
in GitHub environment secrets, required an internet-reachable SSH entry point, and rendered roughly
fifteen production secrets onto a third-party runner's disk on every deploy. Anyone able to run a
workflow in the deploy environment, or to exfiltrate through a compromised action, held a shell on
production.

It also broke. The repository's transfer between organisations did not carry org-level variables and
secrets; they were recreated with a hostname that resolves nowhere, a user the host refuses to log
in as, and a jump-host key that does not authenticate. Staging could not be deployed at all. None of
those failures were detectable before a deploy attempt, because the credentials only exist inside CI.

The project already produces everything a host needs to deploy itself: a cosign-signed release lock
naming every image by digest, and `prepare-release-lock.ts`, which verifies that signature and
renders the lock. Self-hosters already upgrade this way by hand.

## Decision drivers

- No remote party holds a credential that reaches a host; secrets live only where they are used.
- A replayed or stale channel must not verify, and a rollback must be a deliberate, signed act.
- Approval is proven by a signing identity a verifier can check, not by a claim it cannot.
- A deploy that does not converge, or a host that stops reconciling, fails loudly.

## Considered options

1. **Keep pushing from CI over SSH.** Rejected: two long-lived keys and every deployment secret on
   a third-party runner, and a failure mode no check catches before a deploy attempt.
2. **A channel as an OCI artifact under a mutable tag.** Rejected: a tag carries no order, so a
   replayed old channel is indistinguishable from a current one, and GHCR offers no tag
   immutability.
3. **Approval verified from Fulcio's `environment` claim.** Rejected: Fulcio records the claim, but
   cosign exposes no way to verify it.
4. **Roll back automatically when an apply fails.** Rejected: schema changes are forward-only, so
   restoring the previous images would leave old code on a migrated database.
5. **Rootless Podman with Quadlet on the host.** Not attempted: it would remove the root-equivalent
   Docker socket the reconciler still holds, and is the remaining gap.
6. **A host that polls a signed commit channel.** Chosen.

## Decision

A host polls a channel and applies the release it names. Nothing connects to the host.

**The channel is a commit.** Each environment has one file on the `deploy-state` branch naming a
release. The branch carries no code and triggers no workflow.

**Freshness comes from the commit graph.** A signature proves authorship, not currency: a valid old
channel, replayed, verifies. The reconciler accepts only a channel commit that descends from the last
one it accepted. Moving to a lower release additionally requires `allowRollback` on that new commit;
the flag never authorizes replay. This is the property TUF builds timestamp and snapshot roles for,
taken from a history the repository already keeps.

**Approval is bound by identity, not by claim.** The hosts pin the identity of `promote.yml`, and a
GitHub environment gates that workflow: a signature carrying that identity is proof the reviewers
approved. This holds only while `promote.yml` stays non-reusable — a `workflow_call` trigger would
let any caller mint the same identity.

**Staging follows the default branch; production runs releases.** A channel names either a
release or a commit. A release is the promoted artifact: its lock, provenance and signature are
fetched and verified, which is how production moves. A commit has no release to fetch, so the
channel carries the digests to run and the channel's own signature covers them; provenance comes
from GitHub's build attestations, checked per image and bound to the commit being deployed, so an
image retagged onto that commit does not pass.

This is not the same assurance a release carries, and it is worth being exact about the difference.
A release additionally binds the lock to the source tree, enumerates every platform, and gates on the
SBOM, licence and vulnerability policy. A commit channel checks none of those. That is acceptable for
an environment that follows the branch — the code is already merged, and the vulnerability policy is
enforced before the release that reaches production — and it would not be acceptable for production,
which is why production names releases. Only a commit already on the default branch may be
followed.

The split is by environment, not by a setting. An environment that sometimes follows the branch and
sometimes runs a release is two environments sharing a name, and every release would drag staging
from a commit back onto a tag naming the same bytes — a release re-tags the commit's images rather
than rebuilding them. So a release does not promote staging: by the time one exists, staging has
been running that commit since it merged, a longer rehearsal than a pre-production promotion buys.
Holding an environment still is what the channel's `freeze` is for, signed and carried with the
channel rather than configured beside it.

**The host runs the tooling of the release it applied.** The reconciler and the verifier run from
the host's own tooling directory, never from the release being verified: the tick that verifies a
channel runs the tooling of the last release this host accepted, and only once the next release is
verified and applied does the host move its tooling to that release's tree and bring the two systemd
units in `/etc/systemd/system` to the same tree, reloading systemd itself. So a release cannot
supply its own verifier, and the host runs no tooling a signed channel did not name, with two
exceptions: the tooling an operator installs or upgrades by hand runs until the first apply after
it, and a release that predates the tooling link is never adopted, so a host rolled back to one
keeps the tooling it has, while a rollback to a release that carries the link moves the tooling back
with it. That makes a rule for the promoter:
a change to what `promote.yml` writes must stay readable by the tooling of every release a rollback
can still reach, and nothing checks this for it. Standing still is not safe either: a host stranded
on old tooling fails every tick until someone logs in, which is the silent failure this design exists
to avoid.

**A failed apply stops.** It does not roll back. Schema changes are forward-only here, so restoring
the previous images would leave old code on a migrated database. Host monitoring reads the failure
and staleness metrics instead.

**Feedback is observed, not reported.** Because nothing can push the hosts, the promotion workflow
polls the environment's public runtime configuration until it reports the promoted version. A deploy
that does not converge fails in Actions, and a host that stops reconciling raises a staleness alert
from its textfile metrics. Without that alert this design trades a loud failure for a silent one.

## Consequences

Both deploy keys, the jump host, and the deployment secrets leave CI; secrets live only on the host
that uses them. Promotion becomes one gated workflow run, and the git history of `deploy-state` is
the deployment audit log.

The reconciler is as privileged as the SSH user it replaces: write access to the Docker socket is
root-equivalent, and no systemd hardening changes that. What changes is that no remote party holds
it.

An operator must disable the timer before hand-patching a host, or the next tick reverts the fix.

Preview environments are unaffected. They are ephemeral, per-pull-request, and managed by Coolify on
the staging host; the reconciler owns only the Compose projects it is configured for, so the two
manage disjoint resources.

Production adopts this after its outstanding version gap is closed by hand; the mechanism is proven
on staging first.

## Revisit trigger

A verifier that can check the Fulcio `environment` claim, which would let approval be expressed
without pinning one workflow's identity; a need to make `promote.yml` reusable, which this design
forbids; or an incident on the host's Docker socket, which reopens rootless Podman with Quadlet.
