# ADR 0036: Agent runtime runs on Node.js 24 with bounded resources

## Status

Accepted. Supersedes [ADR 0030](0030-agent-runtime-is-typescript-on-bun.md) for the sandbox image.
[ADR 0033](0033-bun-is-the-javascript-runtime-and-package-manager.md) still governs repository tooling.

## Context

ADR 0030 coupled TypeScript checking against the Pi SDK with execution on Bun. Type checking is
runtime-independent, while Bun removed the V8 heap ceiling and in-process out-of-memory diagnostic.
Its native-dependency rationale is obsolete because the Pi SDK no longer depends on `koffi`.

The runner tree executes on Node 24 with native type stripping. Precompute requires a mechanical port
from Bun APIs to Node's standard library.

The runtime must preserve four independent controls:

- V8 heap growth is bounded below the container memory limit.
- Mentor and practice runners can read staged inputs and the SDK but write only sessions and output.
- Application-managed precompute extensions receive no job or proxy credentials.
- Server and image drift is detected and reported before sandbox work.

## Decision

The digest-pinned agent image contains Node 24 and no Bun or package-manager CLI. npm installs the Pi
SDK with lifecycle scripts disabled and is removed with Corepack and its shims. The image build checks
the SDK import, direct filesystem denial, child-process denial, and Bun absence.

Mentor and practice runners use `--max-old-space-size=256` and Node permissions. They may read
`/workspace` and `/opt/pi-sdk`, and write only session state and collected output. The mentor also uses
`--expose-gc`. Repeated filesystem flags define distinct allow-list entries.

Precompute runs separately with a minimal environment, direct filesystem permissions, and
`--allow-child-process` for `grep`. Child programs are not confined by Node's filesystem permissions;
therefore the container's mounts, network policy, non-root user, and credential-free environment are
the effective controls for precompute. The mentor and practice runners receive no child-process grant.

Relative imports include `.ts`, staged workspaces declare `{"type":"module"}`, and TypeScript checking
uses NodeNext resolution with erasable syntax only. Infrastructure suites run with `node:test`.
The server/image runtime contract advances to v2 and records the Node and Pi versions in OCI labels.

## Consequences

V8 old-space exhaustion produces a JavaScript runtime diagnostic instead of relying on the container
limit as the first heap boundary. Mentor and practice writes are restricted in process. The server and
agent image must be upgraded together. Bun remains the repository package manager and tooling runtime.

Node permissions are defense in depth, not a hostile-code sandbox. In particular, the precompute child
process grant makes Docker isolation and environment minimization load-bearing controls.
