# ADR 0010: Hand-roll OAuth state for outbound per-workspace integrations

**Status:** Accepted (amended 2026-05-30 — PKCE primitive removed)
**Date:** 2026-05-25
**Authors:** Integration framework polish (#1198)

> **Amendment (2026-05-30):** The PKCE primitive (`issueWithPkce` → `IssuedState`, the
> `code_verifier` nonce column, and the verifier-carrying consume path) was removed. It was
> never wired into any strategy — both providers (GitHub App, Slack OAuth v2) are
> **confidential clients** authenticating with a `client_secret`, for which PKCE is
> recommended-but-not-required (RFC 9700) and provided no active protection while unwired.
> The signed state payload is now `(workspaceId|kind|issuedAt|nonce|actorRef)`; CSRF/replay
> defense (HMAC + TTL + single-use nonce) is unchanged. A future public-client provider that
> needs PKCE can reintroduce the primitive against this same `OAuthStateService` seam.

## Context

Hephaestus opens outbound OAuth Authorization Code flows from per-workspace admin pages
("Connect GitHub", "Connect GitLab", "Connect Slack"; Outline integration was
removed from this epic — see ADR 0015). The framework
must:

- Survive multi-step flows that may take **minutes** and span **tab close / reopen** (GitHub
  App org-admin approval gates can pause the flow for arbitrary time).
- Bind the resulting credential to a `Connection` row keyed by `(workspaceId, kind,
  instanceKey)` — NOT to the Spring `SecurityContext` principal.
- Run **without a Spring session** at the callback step: the vendor redirects back from
  an unauthenticated browser tab; the only authoritative identity is what we signed into
  `state`.
- Compose with the existing Keycloak `oauth2-resource-server` chain (inbound API auth) —
  Spring Security 6 cannot run resource-server + client filters with conflicting state
  stores against the same `/oauth/**` paths.
- Support **per-instance** ClientRegistration shapes (each Slack workspace has its own
  signing secret; each GitLab self-hosted instance has its own `client_id`).

We examined whether `spring-boot-starter-oauth2-client` could replace the hand-rolled
`HmacOAuthStateService` + `OAuthStateNonceStore` + PKCE plumbing.

## Decision drivers

- **Workspace-keyed token persistence**, not principal-keyed. `OAuth2AuthorizedClientService`'s
  schema has a composite key `(client_registration_id, principal_name)`; hacking
  `workspaceId` into `principal_name` collapses two distinct concepts and silently re-keys
  Spring's intended invariants. See [JdbcOAuth2AuthorizedClientService](https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/current/api/org/springframework/security/oauth2/client/JdbcOAuth2AuthorizedClientService.html).
- **Multi-minute, multi-tab flows.** Spring's default `HttpSessionOAuth2AuthorizationRequestRepository`
  binds state to a session that doesn't survive an admin closing the tab during GitHub
  App approval. Replacing it with a JDBC-backed `AuthorizationRequestRepository` is exactly
  re-implementing `OAuthStateNonceStore` behind Spring's interface — same code, less power
  (no per-row TTL queries, no workspace cross-referencing).
- **Dynamic per-tenant ClientRegistration is not first-class.**
  [spring-security#12862](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/issues/12862)
  is an open enhancement request. Workarounds require a custom `ClientRegistrationRepository`
  with careful concurrent-modification handling. Same effort as hand-rolled; less control.
- **GitHub App ≠ standard OAuth Authorization Code.** GitHub App install callbacks deliver
  `installation_id`, not `code`. There is no token-exchange at the browser callback — the
  installation token is minted server-side via JWT-signed-with-private-key. Spring's
  `OAuth2LoginAuthenticationFilter` at `/login/oauth2/code/{registrationId}` is the wrong
  endpoint shape entirely.
- **Spring's PKCE primitives are validated; we match them.** Our 32-byte SecureRandom →
  43-char base64url-no-pad verifier matches
  [`OAuth2AuthorizationRequestCustomizers.withPkce()`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/blob/main/oauth2/oauth2-client/src/main/java/org/springframework/security/oauth2/client/web/DefaultOAuth2AuthorizationRequestResolver.java)
  byte-for-byte. The cryptographic choice is the same.

## Considered options

1. **Full replace** — rewrite using Spring Security OAuth2 Client end-to-end. Rejected.
   The session-binding, principal-keyed persistence, and single-vendor-flow assumptions
   are baked too deep. Net code reduction is negative once the per-tenant
   `ClientRegistrationRepository` + JDBC `AuthorizationRequestRepository` + custom
   `OAuth2AuthorizedClientService` are written.

2. **Hybrid** — keep the hand-rolled state HMAC + nonce, but adopt:
   - `org.springframework.security.oauth2.core.endpoint.PkceParameterNames` constants
     instead of hardcoded `"code_verifier"` / `"code_challenge"` / `"code_challenge_method"`
     literals (typo prevention on token-exchange POSTs).
   - Reference Spring's `DefaultOAuth2AuthorizationRequestResolver` in Javadoc as the
     primitive we deliberately match.

3. **Hand-roll** the entire flow, document our cryptographic choices in line with RFC 7636
   + RFC 9700, ArchUnit-pin the state token shape. Adopted.

## Decision

**Option 3 (hand-roll), with the small Option 2 alignments** applied where they cost
nothing and reduce future drift:

- Keep `HmacOAuthStateService`, `OAuthStateNonceStore`, the `state` payload shape
  `(workspaceId|kind|issuedAt|nonce|actorRef|codeVerifier?)`, and the single-use
  `consumed_at` conditional UPDATE.
- Keep the PKCE primitive (`issueWithPkce` → `IssuedState`).
- Reference Spring's PKCE primitive in Javadoc so future readers know we matched it
  deliberately rather than reinvented it.
- ArchUnit pins remain: the OAuth state SPI lives under
  `integration/core/oauth/state/`.

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- Workspace-keyed credential persistence keeps the `Connection` aggregate as the single
  authoritative store. No second source of truth via `OAuth2AuthorizedClient`.
- Multi-minute, multi-tab flows work because the nonce row is persistent (DB-backed,
  TTL-pruned via `OAuthStateNonceCleanupJob`).
- New vendor integrations plug into `ConnectionStrategy` without touching Spring Security
  config. The framework can add Linear/Jira/etc. without registering a `ClientRegistration`
  bean per tenant.

**Neutral:**
- Vocabulary aligned with Spring Security where it overlaps: `IssuedState`,
  `StateBinding`, `code_verifier` / `code_challenge` follow Spring naming so future
  migration (if the OSS landscape closes the multi-tenant gap) is a refactor, not a
  rewrite.

**Negative:**
- Maintain ~600 LOC of OAuth state plumbing that Spring would have provided for the
  session-bound case. We accept this cost to keep workspace-binding clean.
- Future engineers will ask "why don't we use `spring-boot-starter-oauth2-client`?".
  This ADR is the standing answer.

## Revisit trigger

Any of:
- Spring Security ships first-class multi-tenant `ClientRegistrationRepository` + a
  per-tenant `OAuth2AuthorizedClientService` schema that keys on something other than
  `principal_name` (track [issue #12862](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/issues/12862)).
- GitHub App flow lands a standard `code` exchange at install time (currently `installation_id`
  is the callback param, not `code`).
- We reach 10+ integration kinds — at that point the per-kind `ConnectionStrategy`
  branching may itself benefit from a registry-as-`ClientRegistrationRepository`
  refactor, evaluated against Spring's then-current shape.
