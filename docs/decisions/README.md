# Architecture Decision Records

Decisions that shape the Hephaestus server foundations. Each ADR follows the
[MADR](https://adr.github.io/madr/) template: context → drivers → considered options
→ decision → consequences → revisit trigger.

New ADRs use the next available number and link from this index.

## These are repo-only — deliberately not on the docs site

`docs/decisions/`, `docs/runbooks/`, `docs/auth-architecture.md` and `docs/auth-glossary.md` are
**not** registered with any Docusaurus plugin and never appear on
[the site](https://docs.hephaestus.build/). That is a decision, not an oversight. They are
written against internal class names, they are amended by the same PR that changes the code, and
their reader already has the repository checked out. This index is their table of contents.

Two rules follow, and CI enforces the second one:

1. **An ADR is a record of a decision, not a changelog.** Context, drivers, options, decision,
   consequences, revisit trigger. A bug fixed after the fact belongs in a changeset
   (`.changeset/*.md`), not in an amendment — amend an ADR only when the decision or one of its
   consequences actually changed.

   **An amendment appends; it never rewrites.** Add a dated `## Update — YYYY-MM-DD (issue #N)`
   block at the end, say which section above it supersedes, and leave that section standing. This
   applies hardest to the considered-and-rejected options: they are the reason a future engineer
   does not re-propose a path that was already priced and declined, and deleting them is what turns
   an ADR into the changelog rule 1 forbids. If a previously rejected option is now the chosen path,
   the update block says so and dates it. [ADR 0005](0005-two-role-runtime-via-conditional-on-property.md)
   is the worked example.
2. **A published page links here by absolute GitHub URL, never a relative path.** A relative
   `../decisions/…` link from `docs/user/`, `docs/contributor/` or `docs/admin/` resolves to
   nothing on the site, and `onBrokenMarkdownLinks: 'throw'` fails the docs build. Use
   `https://github.com/ls1intum/Hephaestus/blob/main/docs/decisions/<file>.md`. Relative links
   *between* files in this tree are fine — they are only ever read on GitHub.

An operator-facing fact must not live only here. If a runbook step is something a self-hoster has to
do, its home is the Admin Guide (`docs/admin/`) and the runbook links to it.
