  Hephaestus /hɪˈfɛstəs/ is the Greek god of blacksmiths, craftsmen, and artisans, symbolizing the fusion of creativity and technical skill.

Introduction
============

Hephaestus is designed to mentor novice developers in agile software development practices. The aim is to integrate Hephaestus into software engineering practical courses, extended university projects, and agile teams in the industry to help learn and apply agile methodologies. Unlike traditional educational tools that offer static content, Hephaestus provides dynamic, real-time guidance, adapting to individual and team needs.

This approach is expected to foster a better understanding and application of agile principles among novice developers, preparing them more effectively for professional software development environments. Hephaestus fills a critical gap in educational technology by actively supporting and enhancing learning in complex, team-based settings.

**Please note:** Hephaestus is currently in the concept and planning phase. The project aims to provide proactive guidance to novice developers, from planning a feature to delivering it to production and beyond.
