Hephaestus: Leveraging Generative AI to Enhance Software Development Processes and Developer Training
=====================================================================================================

Hephaestus leverages generative AI, specifically large language models (LLMs), to enhance the software development lifecycle (SDLC) and developer training. This research project explores how AI can improve each phase of the SDLC — planning, analysis, design, implementation, testing & integration, and maintenance — while also providing comprehensive support for developer onboarding and continuous education. By integrating AI-driven insights and adaptive guidance into these processes, Hephaestus aims to boost efficiency, adherence to best practices, and overall software quality. The project also emphasizes support for agile methodologies, ensuring dynamic and iterative improvements to development workflows.
