Hephaestus notifies users when automated best-practice detection finds issues. Different SMTP providers are used in development and production.

## Development setup (Gmail example)

1. Create or use a dedicated Gmail account.
2. Generate an app-specific password ([Google docs](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/185833)).
3. Add the following properties to your `application-local.yml`:

   ```yaml
   mail:
     host: smtp.gmail.com
     port: 587
     username: hephaestus@example.com
     password: <app-password>
   ```

   Alternatively, set `POSTFIX_USERNAME` and `POSTFIX_PASSWORD` environment variables.

## Production setup

- Production uses a Postfix relay provided by TUM.
- Copy `main.cf` and `master.cf` from [`ls1admin/postfix-container-tum-mailrelay`](https://github.com/ls1admin/postfix-container-tum-mailrelay).
- Secrets and credentials are managed by the deployment team; avoid committing them to the repository.
