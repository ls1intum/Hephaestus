# Integration sync lifecycle

What each integration actually does at every phase of its life, from first connect to erasure.
Companion to [ADR 0024](https://github.com/ls1intum/Hephaestus/blob/main/docs/decisions/0024-integration-sync-lifecycle-and-two-deletion-semantics.md),
which records *why* the two deletion semantics are separate.

## The cohesive principle

Every integration consumes the vendor's own machine-readable contract, and Hephaestus hand-writes
only transport policy — retries, rate-limit accounting, pagination bounds, tenancy, consent.

| Integration | Contract | Generated from |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GitHub | GraphQL schema | `graphql-codegen-maven-plugin` → `…scm.github.graphql` |
| GitLab | GraphQL schema | `graphql-codegen-maven-plugin` → `…scm.gitlab.graphql` |
| Slack | Official SDK | `com.slack.api:bolt` |
| Outline | OpenAPI spec | `openapi-generator-maven-plugin` → `spec3.yml` + `outline-supplement.yaml` |

Schemas and specs are refreshed by `pnpm run github:update-schema`, `gitlab:update-schema`, and
`outline:update-spec`. No integration hand-rolls a vendor DTO.

## The matrix

| Phase | GitHub | GitLab | Slack | Outline |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Initial sync** | App install: after monitors materialise from installation metadata. PAT: on the `Activated` AFTER_COMMIT event. Recorded as an `INITIAL` job. | On `Activated` → `GitLabWorkspaceInitializationService.initializeAsync`, which also starts the NATS scope consumer. `INITIAL` job. | **None at connect.** Ingestion is per-channel and forward-only from the consent announcement. | On `Activated` → register the webhook subscription, then a recency sync. Recorded job. |
| **Live updates** | `POST /webhooks/github` → `github.<owner>.<repo>.<event>`; repository-lifecycle events ride `github.<owner>.?.repository`. | `POST /webhooks/gitlab` → `gitlab.<namespace>.<project>.<event>`; project/subgroup/member events ride `gitlab.<rootGroup>.?.<event>`. Group hook auto-registered on connect. | Events API → `slack.<team>.<scope>.<event>`; consent re-checked per message. | Vendor webhook subscription → `outline.<subscriptionId>.<event>`. |
| **Periodic reconcile** | `hephaestus.sync.cron`, default daily 03:00; per-repository cooldown. | Same cron and scheduler shape. | `hephaestus.sync.slack.cron`, default daily 04:00 — replays `conversations.history` for ACTIVE channels. | `…outline.sync.cron`, default every 6 h, plus a 5-minute catch-up tick for collections still awaiting a clean pass. |
| **Backfill** | Supported. Scheduled cycle gated by `hephaestus.sync.backfill.enabled` (off by default); manual backfill always offered and loops until complete or cancelled. | Supported. One batch per pending repository per click; the scheduled cycle drains the rest at its 5-minute cooldown. | **Not supported**, deliberately: pre-consent and paused-gap history must never be fetched. | **Not supported.** The reconcile is a full enumeration; there is no older horizon to walk. |
| **Upstream deletion** | `RECONCILIATION` sweep tombstones issues/PRs (fail-closed). `repository.deleted` webhook removes repo + monitors. | `RECONCILIATION` sweep tombstones issues/MRs (fail-closed). GitLab emits **no** issue/MR deletion webhook at all. | **No inference from absence.** `message_deleted` → tombstone; `channel_deleted` → erase our copy; `channel_archive` / `channel_left` → PAUSED. | `RECONCILIATION` only: a **clean** full enumeration tombstones that collection's vanished documents (fail-closed). `documents.delete` / `documents.permanent_delete` tombstone immediately. |
| **Erasure on disconnect / purge** | `ScmWorkspaceContentEraser` — hard delete, orphan-guarded. | Same eraser. Disconnect is GitLab's **only** erase trigger (no vendor uninstall signal). | `SlackWorkspaceContentEraser` — hard delete of messages, threads, monitored channels, consent, mentor threads. | Hard delete of `outline_document`, `outline_collection`, `outline_document_event` + webhook deregistration. |
| **Rename / transfer healing** | Real time within the same owner: the mirrored row and **every** monitor are re-keyed by the stable `repository.id`. Cross-owner transfer heals on the next reconcile. | Project rename/move rides the root-group tier and re-keys by native id; a move across root groups heals on the next reconcile. | Channel rename handled on the consent/monitored-channel record. | Documents are keyed by `documentId`; a title or collection rename is ordinary metadata. |

## The rules the matrix depends on

### Fail-closed: an incomplete listing deletes nothing

A sweep may tombstone only what a **provably complete** upstream listing omits.
`UpstreamListing.complete()` starts `false` and is set on exactly one clean exit: pagination ran to
`hasNextPage == false`, with no rate-limit abort, no GraphQL error, no exception, no page-cap
truncation, no cancellation, and a node count that agrees exactly with the server's own
`totalCount`. Any doubt skips the entity class entirely. A partial listing is never merged with a
previous one. Outline's equivalent: a truncated enumeration throws rather than returning a short
list, and a budget-exhausted pass tombstones nothing.

### Reconciliation-only: an `INITIAL` job never infers a deletion

`INITIAL` jobs never sweep — a mirror still being populated has nothing stale in it, and every row
not yet fetched would look like an upstream deletion to a set difference. That is also why a manual
`INITIAL` is rejected at the API; only `RECONCILIATION` and `BACKFILL` are client-triggerable.

This holds **uniformly across every integration that infers deletion from absence**, not just the SCM
pair. Each runner forwards its `SyncJobType` rather than dropping it, and the inference sits behind a
`type == RECONCILIATION` gate: `GithubDataSyncScheduler` / `GitlabDataSyncScheduler` before the
deletion sweep, and `OutlineDocumentSyncService#syncOneCollection` before `tombstoneVanished`. Slack
needs no gate — it never infers deletion from absence at all (deletions arrive as `message_deleted` /
`channel_deleted` events), so its runner genuinely does not use `type`.

The two guards are independent and both must hold before anything is tombstoned: the enumeration must
be provably **complete**, *and* the job must be a **`RECONCILIATION`**. A budget-exhausted or
truncated Outline pass therefore deletes nothing even on a reconcile.

### Tombstone ≠ erasure

Two operations, two triggers, deliberately sharing no code.

| | Drift tombstone | Mirror erasure |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Trigger | A reconcile pass observes an artifact missing upstream | Admin disconnect, or workspace purge |
| Effect | `deleted_at` marker; content-bearing fields cleared | Hard `DELETE`, including of tombstoned rows |
| Reversible | Yes — `upsertCore` clears `deleted_at` on the next sync | No |
| Basis | Sync fidelity | The lawful basis for holding the mirror is gone |

A tombstoned row is still queryable retained personal data, so a tombstone can never implement the
disconnect trigger. A hard delete destroys data the drift sweep expects to be able to resurrect, so
erasure can never implement the drift path.

### Erasure is orphan-guarded

SCM tables carry no `workspace_id`: `repository` and its cascade are instance-global and shared
between workspaces monitoring the same source repository. `ScmWorkspaceContentEraser` therefore
removes *this* workspace's `repository_to_monitor` rows, flushes, and delegates each repository to
`WorkspaceRepositoryMonitorService#deleteRepositoryIfOrphaned`, which deletes the local clone,
publishes `RepositoryAboutToBeDeletedEvent`, and drops the row **only** when no monitor anywhere
still points at it. The org tier (`team`, `team_membership`, `organization_membership`) has its own
guard — no repository cascade reaches it — and is erased only when no other non-purged workspace is
bound to the same `Organization`. The `Organization` row itself is global: unlinked, never deleted.

Derived rows go first, while the artifacts they reference still exist: the eraser publishes a
synchronous in-transaction `ScmMirrorErasedEvent`, and `practices` (SCM-artifact observations and
feedback) and `activity` (`activity_event`) listen.

Disconnect and purge reach the identical end state by construction — the purge contributor
(order `-200`) and the connection `revoke` callback both call the same eraser.

### Retained on both erase triggers

`sync_job`, `connection_activity` and `connection_audit` survive for all four integration kinds:
operational audit only (kind, type, status, timestamps), no mirrored third-party content, capped per
connection by the sync-job pruner. Global identity rows (`user`, `organization`,
`identity_provider`) are cross-tenant shared and never touched here.

## Documented asymmetries and residuals

- **Slack has no deletion *sweep* at all.** Its content model is append-plus-watermark and a message
  absent from a `conversations.history` page usually means pagination truncation, a filtered subtype,
  or a thread reply — inferring deletion from absence would mass-delete. Deletions arrive as events
  instead. Outline *does* infer deletion from absence, but not as a separate sweep phase: it
  tombstones inline at the end of each collection's clean enumeration, under the same
  reconciliation-only rule as the SCM sweeps.
- **Cross-owner GitHub transfer heals only on reconcile.** The event derives the *new* owner's
  subject and so reaches no filter of the old workspace. The next reconcile resolves the monitor by
  `native_id`. GitLab has the identical residual across root groups.
- **Legacy rows without `native_id`** fall back to a previous-`owner/name` lookup, which a
  simultaneous rename-and-transfer can miss; those rows acquire a `native_id` on their next sync.
- **No replay across a filter rebuild.** Repository-scoped events published between a rename and the
  consumer-filter rebuild were never pending for the durable consumer and are not redelivered; the
  next reconcile's full pass backfills them.
- **Slack paused gaps are never backfilled.** Resuming a PAUSED channel stamps the watermark to the
  resume instant, so messages sent while monitoring was off stay out of the mirror permanently.
- **Reconnect is a fresh start, not a restore.** Because disconnect erases, reconnecting re-fetches
  from the vendor and cannot recover what the vendor no longer has.
