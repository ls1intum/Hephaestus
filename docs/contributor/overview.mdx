description: Orientation for engineers who build and operate the Hephaestus platform.
---

Hephaestus is maintained by the Applied Education Technologies (AET) team at TUM. It delivers **process-aware mentoring for agile software teams**, blending repo-grounded AI guidance with real-time review analytics. This guide captures the operational knowledge you need to contribute confidently—from local development to production releases.

## How to use this guide

- Start with **Local development** to prepare your workstation and understand the tooling expectations per service.
- Review **Release management** and **Testing** before opening a PR—automation enforces the conventions documented there.
- Dive into **System design** and **Database** when implementing larger features or debugging cross-service flows.
- Follow the **Coding & design guidelines** to keep the codebase consistent across services.

## Shared principles

1. **Security first** - OAuth scopes are scoped to least privilege; secrets are injected via managed infrastructure.
2. **Observability by default** - We ship structured logs and OpenTelemetry traces in every service.
3. **Accessible experiences** - The React webapp targets WCAG 2.1 AA; accessibility regressions must be addressed before release.
4. **Research friendly** - Experiments and short-lived features sit behind feature flags and are documented for replication.

Continue with [Local development](./local-development) to set up your environment.
