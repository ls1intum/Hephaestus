description: Prepare your workstation and run each Hephaestus service locally.
---

Hephaestus supports full-stack development across Java, TypeScript, and Python. This guide focuses on the development environment; production operations are covered in the [Admin Guide](/admin/production-setup).

## Prerequisites

Install and configure the following tools before you attempt a local build:

1. **Java JDK 21** – Required for the Spring Boot application server.
2. **Docker Desktop** – Used for PostgreSQL, Keycloak, and NATS containers.
3. **Node.js LTS (>= 22.10)** and **npm (>= 10.8)** – For the React client.
4. **Python (>= 3.13)** and **Poetry (>= 2.0)** – For the FastAPI intelligence service.
5. **NATS CLI (optional)** – Helpful when debugging webhook messages.

## Recommended IDE setup

Open the repository using the `project.code-workspace` file in VS Code and install the workspace recommendations (`@recommended` in the Extensions view). Key extensions include:

- Java Extension Pack
- Spring Boot tools
- Python and Poetry support
- ESLint + Prettier
- Tailwind CSS IntelliSense

JetBrains alternatives such as IntelliJ (Java), WebStorm (React), and PyCharm (Python) work equally well.

## Application server

### Maven profiles and local configuration

We ship three Maven profiles: `local` (default), `prod`, and `spec`. For development stick to the `local` profile.

Create `application-server/src/main/resources/application-local.yml` to override defaults. This file is gitignored.

:::caution Keep it local
Never commit `application-local.yml`. It may contain secrets and machine-specific configuration.
:::

### Running the server

1. Start Docker Desktop.
2. From `server/application-server`, run:

   ```bash
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```

3. Access the API at `http://localhost:8080` or explore `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html`.

### GitHub configuration

Hephaestus supports two GitHub authentication modes. Pick the one that fits your workflow:

| Mode | Best for | Workspace creation | Repository monitors |
|------|----------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **PAT** | Quick local development | Manual (from config) | Manual (you list them) |
| **GitHub App** | Testing webhooks, production | Automatic (from installations) | Automatic (from installation events) |

#### Option A: Personal Access Token (simpler)

1. [Create a Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) with scopes: `repo`, `read:org`, `read:user`.

2. Create `application-local.yml`:

   ```yaml
   hephaestus:
     workspace:
       init-default: true
       default:
         login: your-github-org      # e.g., "ls1intum" or "HephaestusTest"
         token: ghp_your_token
         repositories-to-monitor:
           - your-github-org/repo1
           - your-github-org/repo2
   ```

3. Leave `github.app.id` unset or set to `0`.

#### Option B: GitHub App

1. [Create a GitHub App](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps) with appropriate permissions.

2. Create `application-local.yml`:

   ```yaml
   github:
     app:
       id: 12345
       privateKey: |
         -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
         ...
         -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----

   hephaestus:
     workspace:
       init-default: false   # Workspaces created from installations
   ```

3. Install the app on your organization. Workspaces and monitors are created automatically.

### Limiting sync scope (development filters)

When using GitHub App mode, your app might have access to hundreds of repositories. Use filters to focus on specific orgs/repos during development:

```yaml
monitoring:
  filters:
    allowed-organizations:
      - ls1intum
      - HephaestusTest
    allowed-repositories:
      - ls1intum/Hephaestus
      - ls1intum/Artemis
      - HephaestusTest/demo-repository
```

Empty lists = no filtering (production behavior). Non-empty = only sync matching items.

:::tip
Filters don't delete data—they just skip sync operations. Workspace and organization metadata is still created for all installations.
:::

### Keycloak integration

Keycloak runs in Docker as part of the development compose stack. The bundled realm import no longer ships test users—authentication always flows through GitHub and mirrors production.

#### Configure the GitHub identity provider

1. [Create a new GitHub OAuth application](https://github.com/settings/developers) with the callback URL `http://localhost:8081/realms/hephaestus/broker/github/endpoint`.
2. Export the generated **Client ID** and **Client secret**, then copy `server/application-server/.env.example` to `server/application-server/.env` and update the placeholders:

   ```bash
   cp server/application-server/.env.example server/application-server/.env
   KEYCLOAK_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=<github-client-id>
   KEYCLOAK_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=<github-client-secret>
   KEYCLOAK_GITHUB_ADMIN_USERNAME=<github-handle-with-admin-access>
   ```

   The Keycloak container resolves these placeholders during realm import, as documented in the [Keycloak import guide](https://www.keycloak.org/server/importExport#_using_environment_variables_within_the_realm_configuration_files).
3. (Re)start the local stack: `docker compose up keycloak postgres`. On first boot Keycloak imports `keycloak-hephaestus-realm-example-config.json` and wires the GitHub provider automatically.
4. Sign in via GitHub using the account referenced by `KEYCLOAK_GITHUB_ADMIN_USERNAME`. During the first brokered login Keycloak automatically grants that account the `admin` realm role and the `realm-management` → `realm-admin` client role, unlocking the administrative views in the application server and Keycloak console.

### Webhook ingest service

When you run `docker/compose.core.yaml` or the `server/webhook-ingest/compose.yaml` stack, set the webhook secrets up front so signature checks succeed:

```bash
cp docker/.env.example docker/.env
export WEBHOOK_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
echo "WEBHOOK_SECRET=$WEBHOOK_SECRET" >> docker/.env
```

The value must match the secret configured on your GitHub and GitLab webhooks (validated via `X-Hub-Signature-256` when available).

## Web client (`webapp`)

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start Vite on port 4200:

   ```bash
   npm -w webapp run dev
   ```

3. Visit `http://localhost:4200`.

### UI foundations

- We ship Tailwind CSS 4 in JIT mode. Keep utility classes in JSX and rely on design tokens defined in `src/styles.css`.
- Ensure Tailwind IntelliSense is enabled in your IDE—typeahead prevents typos and invalid compositions.
- Avoid premature abstractions with `@apply`; duplication is fine when it keeps components readable.

### Component workflow (Storybook + Chromatic)

Storybook is the source of truth for presentational components.

```bash
npm -w webapp run storybook           # Local playground on http://localhost:6006
npm -w webapp run build-storybook     # Static bundle for Chromatic
npm -w webapp run chromatic:ci        # Visual regression in CI
```

- Every new UI component ships with at least one story covering empty, loading, and error states.
- Chromatic runs on every pull request—review visual diffs before merging.
- Reference [ui.shadcn.com](https://ui.shadcn.com/) for composition patterns; stick to headless Radix primitives when you need new widgets.

### OpenAPI client

The generated client in `src/api` is the only way the webapp talks to server services.

```bash
npm -w webapp run openapi-ts
```

- Generated types drop the `Dto` suffix and mirror the Spring Boot API responses.
- Pair every new endpoint with a typed TanStack Query hook for caching and invalidation.
- Never hand-roll fetch calls—shared interceptors handle auth tokens and error telemetry.

## Intelligence service (`server/intelligence-service`)

The intelligence service is a Node.js/TypeScript application using Hono and AI SDK v6. For detailed documentation including AI observability setup with Langfuse, see the dedicated [Intelligence Service guide](/contributor/intelligence-service).

Quick start:

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd server/intelligence-service
   npm install
   ```

2. Configure environment:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your DATABASE_URL and LLM provider credentials
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The service is available at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) with interactive docs at `/docs`.
