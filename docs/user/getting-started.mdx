description: Sign in, connect repositories, and understand the core navigation before your first week on Hephaestus.
---

## Requirements before you start

- A GitHub account that belongs to the organisation your course or team uses.
- Access to [hephaestus.aet.cit.tum.de](https://hephaestus.aet.cit.tum.de) (course staff install the GitHub App for you).
- A modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari) with third-party cookies enabled for OAuth.

## First-time sign-in

1. Navigate to [hephaestus.aet.cit.tum.de](https://hephaestus.aet.cit.tum.de).
2. Choose **Continue with GitHub** and complete the authorisation flow. Hephaestus only requests the minimal scopes required to read pull requests in repositories authorised by your organisation.
3. When the redirect completes you land in the single workspace associated with your organisation. There is no invite flow—the GitHub App handles membership automatically.
4. Your GitHub teams and repository permissions sync in the background. Hephaestus mirrors them, so you will only see activity for the repos you already touch on GitHub.

:::info Teams are GitHub-driven
Need to change the team or repositories you appear under? Ask an organisation maintainer to update the GitHub team membership or App installation—Hephaestus refreshes automatically.

## Tour the main navigation

| Area | Why it matters |
| --- | --- |
| **Dashboard** | Home base with your weekly objectives, mentoring reminders, and quick access to the mentor or leaderboard. |
| **Mentor** | Launch Heph sessions for retrospectives, code review reflections, and standup prep. All conversations are stored as artifacts. |
| **Leaderboard** | Real-time ranking of review activity. Filters for team and repository reflect the GitHub setup your organisation already maintains. |
| **Artifacts** | Library of mentor-generated documents (summaries, action plans, standup tables). Share or export them as Markdown. |
| **Settings** | Review your synced GitHub identity and personal preferences. Repository access and team membership remain read-only because they come from GitHub. |

## Gain traction in your first week

1. **Trigger your first mentor session.** Navigate to **Mentor → Start session** and pick the *Sprint retrospective* template. Heph will walk you through goal setting, PR highlights, and next steps.
2. **Review leaderboard insights.** Switch to the **Leaderboard** tab to see how your activity compares with your team. Apply the repository filter if your organisation monitors multiple projects.
3. **Pin follow-up actions.** From the session summary, pin the generated checklist to your dashboard. You will see progress indicators as you check off items during the week.

## Staying informed

- **Dashboard insights** surface outstanding mentor actions and highlight recent leaderboard changes.
- **In-app notifications** appear when new artifacts are shared with you or when course staff post announcements.
- Planned features such as Slack or email digests are on the roadmap but not yet available in production deployments.
