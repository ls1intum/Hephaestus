description: Sign in, connect repositories, and understand the core navigation before your first week on Hephaestus.
---

## Requirements before you start

- A GitHub account that belongs to your course organisation or project workspace.
- An invitation email or registration link for your Hephaestus workspace.
- A modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari) with third-party cookies enabled for OAuth.
- Optional: Slack access if your course uses automated leaderboard announcements.

## First-time sign-in

1. Navigate to [hephaestus.aet.cit.tum.de](https://hephaestus.aet.cit.tum.de).
2. Choose **Continue with GitHub** and complete the authorisation flow. Hephaestus only requests the minimal scopes required to read pull requests in repositories you are assigned to.
3. Accept the workspace invitation. The onboarding wizard will prompt you to
   - Select your **team** (you can belong to multiple teams),
   - Pick the repositories you actively review, and
   - Opt in to weekly Slack or email digests.
4. Finish the onboarding checklist—your dashboard will load with initial goals from course staff if they configured any.

If your invite expired or you joined the course late, contact your teaching team. Workspace membership is limited to organisation managers for privacy reasons.

## Tour the main navigation

| Area | Why it matters |
| --- | --- |
| **Dashboard** | Home base with your weekly objectives, mentoring reminders, and quick access to the mentor or leaderboard. |
| **Mentor** | Launch Heph sessions for retrospectives, code review reflections, and standup prep. All conversations are stored as artifacts. |
| **Leaderboard** | Real-time ranking of review activity. Filter by team, repository, timeframe, or labels to spotlight the work that matters. |
| **Artifacts** | Library of mentor-generated documents (summaries, action plans, standup tables). Share or export them as Markdown. |
| **Settings** | Manage repositories, notification preferences, data visibility, and integrations such as Slack. |

## Gain traction in your first week

1. **Trigger your first mentor session.** Navigate to **Mentor → Start session** and pick the *Sprint retrospective* template. Heph will walk you through goal setting, PR highlights, and next steps.
2. **Review leaderboard insights.** Switch to the **Leaderboard** tab to see how your activity compares with your team. Apply the repository filter if your organisation monitors multiple projects.
3. **Pin follow-up actions.** From the session summary, pin the generated checklist to your dashboard. You will see progress indicators as you check off items during the week.

## Staying informed

- **Slack digests** celebrate the top three reviewers every Monday and link to your workspace leaderboard.
- **Email reminders** summarise outstanding mentor actions and surface unresolved review feedback.
- **In-app notifications** highlight when new artifacts are shared with you or when a workspace manager updates repository access.
