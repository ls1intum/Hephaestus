description: Configure repositories, teams, and permissions so Hephaestus tracks the right activity for your organisation.

Workspaces connect Hephaestus to the GitHub repositories your cohort relies on. They also define the teams used for leaderboard filters and mentoring groups.

:::caution Workspace managers only
For privacy reasons, only organisation managers or appointed workspace administrators can change repository or team assignments. Reach out to your manager if you need an update.
:::

## Repository configuration

Adding repositories determines which pull requests, reviews, and issues Hephaestus monitors. Workspace managers should:

1. Open **Settings → Repositories**.
2. Select the repositories to monitor. You can add or remove them at any time.
3. Choose if archived repositories should be included for historical reporting.

Hephaestus continuously syncs data from the selected repositories. Expect the first sync to take several minutes depending on history.

## Teams and membership

Teams allow you to filter the leaderboard and mentoring analytics for a specific cohort or tutorial group.

1. Navigate to **Settings → Teams**.
2. Create a team, assign it a distinctive colour, and add the relevant repositories.
3. Add members by GitHub username. A developer can belong to multiple teams.
4. (Optional) Assign GitHub labels to the team to scope leaderboard metrics even further.

:::tip Keep data focused
Only assign repositories to a team that match its scope. Large organisations should use GitHub labels in addition to teams to keep comparisons fair.

## Troubleshooting

- **Repository missing?** Confirm the GitHub organisation owner granted the Hephaestus app access to the repository.
- **Team not visible in filters?** Ensure the team contains at least one repository and one member.
- **Need to migrate workspace data?** Contact the Hephaestus support team with the workspace ID so they can assist.
