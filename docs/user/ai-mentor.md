## Heph in a nutshell

Heph is the conversational agent embedded inside Hephaestus. It guides you through self-regulated learning cycles, encourages peer feedback, and turns insights into actionable checklists.

## Session templates

- **Sprint retrospective** – Review goals, obstacles, and wins from the last iteration.
- **Code review reflection** – Analyse a challenging pull request and capture lessons learned.
- **Standup preparation** – Convert your reflections into a table you can paste into your team's channel.

Each template contains domain-aware prompts that reference your recent GitHub activity. The mentor adapts using repository metadata and prior session notes.

## Managing artifacts

After closing a session you can:

- Pin the artifact to your dashboard for reminders.
- Share a read-only link with your team.
- Export to Markdown or copy into Notion/Confluence.

All artifacts are versioned. Deleting an artifact moves it to the recycle bin for 30 days, allowing instructors to restore accidental removals.

## Privacy and controls

- Only team mentors and instructors can read your artifacts by default.
- You can opt to hide specific reflections from the leaderboard sentiment analysis.
- Administrators configure retention periods in `Admin → Settings → Data governance`.
