Hephaestus provides a weekly leaderboard that tracks review engagement across your workspace. Scores are recalculated continuously so you can see the impact of your contributions in near real time.

## Accessing the leaderboard

Sign in with your GitHub account. The leaderboard is the landing page, and you can always return to it by selecting the Hephaestus logo in the top-left corner.

## Reading the overview card

The overview card summarises your standing in the current competition:

- Current rank within the selected leaderboard.
- Time remaining until the week resets.
- Projected **league point** adjustment based on your position.
- Your league tier and progress towards the next tier.

## Table columns and reviewer drawer

The leaderboard table includes rank, contributor, leaderboard score, and activity summary. Selecting any reviewer opens a detailed drawer that shows:

- Pull requests reviewed that week with direct GitHub links.
- Key statistics such as additions, deletions, and review sentiment.
- A **Copy** action that formats review highlights for sharing in standups or retrospectives.

## Exploring previous weeks and teams

- Use the **time period** dropdown to switch between the current and previous weeks (the last four are stored by default).
- Apply the **team filter** to compare performance within specific cohorts. Your personal rank only appears when the selected team includes you.
- Filter by **labels** when your organisation tags pull requests per exercise or milestone.

## Recognition and notifications

Hephaestus automatically posts the top three reviewers to Slack every Monday with quick links to their highlighted pull requests. Enable notifications in **Settings â†’ Integrations** to receive the digest. You can also opt in to email summaries that recap your personal activity.
