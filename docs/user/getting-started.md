## Access requirements

- A TUM GitHub account with access to your course organization or project repository.
- An invitation to your Hephaestus workspace or a registration link supplied by your course staff.
- A modern browser (latest Chrome, Edge, or Firefox) with third-party cookies enabled for the GitHub OAuth flow.

## First sign-in

1. Navigate to [hephaestus.aet.cit.tum.de](https://hephaestus.aet.cit.tum.de).
2. Select **Continue with GitHub** and authorize the application. Hephaestus requests read-only permissions for repositories and pull requests within your allowed organizations.
3. On first login, select your **team** and the repositories you will actively review. You can adjust this later in **Settings → Repositories**.

## Exploring the workspace

| Area | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| **Dashboard** | Shows your current streak, mentoring reminders, and the next actions recommended by Heph. |
| **Leaderboard** | Ranks individual and team review activity. Filter by time range, labels, and repositories. |
| **Mentor Sessions** | Start reflective conversations with Heph. Your decisions sync back to the dashboard and optional standup exports. |
| **Artifacts** | Browse documents generated during mentoring sessions (retrospectives, action plans, standups). |

## Setting personal objectives

1. Open **Mentor → Start a new session**.
2. Select a template (e.g., sprint retrospective or code review reflection).
3. Answer the prompts. Heph will summarize the conversation and suggest focus areas.
4. Pin the resulting artifact to your dashboard to track progress during the week.

## Notifications

- Weekly Slack digests celebrate top reviewers and share links to the full leaderboard.
- Optional email digests summarize your mentor actions and pending follow-ups.
