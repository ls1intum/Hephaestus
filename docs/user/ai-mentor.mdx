Heph — our process-aware AI mentor — delivers personalized, data-informed feedback grounded in the issues, commits, reviews, and pull requests you work on. It guides self-reflection, keeps track of progress, and reduces stress by organizing check-ins throughout the project lifecycle.

## Launching a session

Open the AI mentor from the top navigation bar and select **Start session** to begin—Heph kicks off the conversation for you.

### Pull request overview

Heph analyses the repositories connected to your workspace and lists pull requests active in the last week. Select the PRs relevant to your progress summary—these will inform later prompts.

### Status updates

Heph walks you through what you achieved, obstacles you encountered, and what you plan next. The mentor adapts its follow-up questions based on the PRs and goals you highlighted earlier.

### Session summary

At the end of each session, Heph generates a summary that doubles as a standup report. Review the summary and make edits as needed.

When you are satisfied, save the summary as an artifact. You can export it as Markdown, share a link with your team, or pin it to your dashboard to track follow-up actions.
