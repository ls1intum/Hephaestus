# Hephaestus Documentation

This site is powered by [Docusaurus 3](https://docusaurus.io/) and mirrors the copy and feature set of the live Hephaestus webapp. The content is split into three guides — User, Contributor, and Admin — plus a lightweight update log.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js ≥ 22.10 (matches the webapp toolchain)
- npm ≥ 10.8

Install dependencies once:

```bash
npm install
```

## Local development

```bash
npm start
```

This boots the docs at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Edits to Markdown/MDX, React components, and CSS hot-reload automatically.

## Quality gates

Run the same checks that CI executes:

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm run build
```

`npm run build` validates links and Markdown while generating the static site under `build/`.

## Content layout

- `user/` &mdash; End-user workflows (mentor sessions, leaderboard, workspace management)
- `contributor/` &mdash; Engineering guides, ERD + StarUML assets, and local development setup
- `admin/` &mdash; Production deployment runbooks
- `blog/` &mdash; Release notes for documentation and product updates

Static assets live under `static/`. The StarUML project is available at `/files/hephaestus-system-model.mdj`, and the autogenerated ERD stays in `docs/contributor/erd/schema.mmd`.

## Deployment

The repository uses GitHub Pages via `npm run deploy`. Ensure your local Git is configured with a token that can push to the `gh-pages` branch or export `GIT_USER` appropriately.
