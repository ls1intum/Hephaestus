## GitHub-driven Teams Overview

The old team admin created recurring maintenance work. With 0.9.0, Hephaestus syncs repository permissions and members from GitHub. The Teams Contributors page reflects the latest changes without any manual updates.

## Teams Leaderboard

Once your teams are in sync, the next step is keeping them accountable. The 0.9.0 leaderboard aggregates each team's code review metrics so you can compare how they are tracking in the current iteration.
