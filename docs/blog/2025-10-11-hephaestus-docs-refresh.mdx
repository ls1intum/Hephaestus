title: Hephaestus documentation goes all-in on Docusaurus
authors: [felixtjdietrich]
tags: [release]
description: A refreshed documentation home that mirrors the product voice and keeps every guide in sync with the platform.

We just finished migrating the entire Hephaestus knowledge base from our legacy Sphinx site into Docusaurus. The new docs are faster to navigate, easier to contribute to, and — most importantly — perfectly aligned with the copy and flows you see in the product.

## Highlights

- **Process-aware homepage.** The landing page now uses the same hero copy, features, and storytelling as the production webapp.
- **Complete migration.** All user, contributor, and admin guides from the Sphinx era live here with refreshed screenshots and cross-links.
- **Single source for diagrams.** StarUML and Mermaid exports are stored under version control so architecture and ERD updates stay reproducible.
- **Better contributor ergonomics.** Automated scripts point to the new ERD path and Storybook/Tailwind guidance documents the expected workflows.

## What to read next

- New to Hephaestus? Start with the [User Guide](/user/overview) and follow the weekly rituals end-to-end.
- Extending the platform? Head straight to [Local Development](/contributor/local-development) and [Coding Guidelines](/contributor/coding-guidelines).
- Running the production stack? The [Admin Guide](/admin/production-setup) covers deployment, monitoring, and identity.

We will continue to expand these docs alongside the webapp. If you spot something missing, open an issue or drop into the `#hephaestus-docs` channel on Slack.
