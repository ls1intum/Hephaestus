title: Performance Guidelines
description: Optimize frontend and backend performance in Hephaestus.
---

This section contains guidelines for optimizing the performance of the Hephaestus application. Performance is a critical aspect of the user experience and should be considered at all stages of development.

### General Performance Principles

1. **Minimize network requests**: Reduce the number of HTTP requests by bundling resources, using caching, and optimizing API calls.
2. **Optimize data transfer**: Only transfer the data that is needed for the current operation.
3. **Use efficient algorithms**: Choose algorithms with appropriate time and space complexity for the task at hand.
4. **Implement caching**: Use caching strategies to avoid redundant computations and data fetching.
5. **Optimize database queries**: Write efficient database queries that retrieve only the necessary data and use appropriate indexes.

### Specific Optimization Techniques

#### Frontend Optimizations

- Use lazy loading for components and modules that are not immediately needed
- Implement virtual scrolling for large lists
- Optimize images and other assets
- Use memoization for expensive computations
- Implement proper state management to avoid unnecessary re-renders

#### Backend Optimizations

- Use connection pooling for database connections
- Implement caching for frequently accessed data
- Use asynchronous processing for long-running tasks
- Optimize database queries with proper indexing
- Use pagination for large data sets
