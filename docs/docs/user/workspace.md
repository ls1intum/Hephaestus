## Overview

Workspaces in Hephaestus serve as the connection point to your GitHub repositories. They enable dynamic configuration of which repositories Hephaestus should monitor for data collection. Additionally, workspaces support the creation of teams, allowing for granular organization and categorization of users within your organization.

:::caution
For data privacy reasons, workspace management is restricted to organization managers. Request configuration changes through your designated organization manager or a Hephaestus administrator.

## Configuring Repositories

Enable automatic data collection from your GitHub repositories by adding them to a Hephaestus workspace. This configuration step ensures that Hephaestus monitors the specified repositories.

## Configuring Teams and Users

Teams provide a mechanism for categorizing users within your organization. Users can belong to multiple teams. Each team, unique to its workspace and identifiable by a specific color, should be assigned only the repositories relevant to its members' scope of work. This ensures focused access and data relevance. For large repositories, the assignment can further be customized using GitHub tags.
