Hephaestus (/hɪˈfɛstəs/) is the Greek god of blacksmiths, craftsmen, and artisans—an apt inspiration for a platform that fuses creativity with technical excellence.

## Main features

   - **Weekly leaderboard:** Stay motivated with a dynamic leaderboard that updates in real time via GitHub integration. Earn points for review activity, explore detailed statistics, and quickly copy pull-request links.
   - **Team competitions:** Foster a collaborative spirit with team leaderboards that span multiple repositories and support label-based filtering.
   - **Leagues:** Engage in a structured league system where consistent review efforts grow an Elo-like ranking, adding a competitive edge to code reviews.
   - **Automated recognition:** Celebrate excellence with weekly Slack notifications that highlight the top three reviewers and link to the previous week's leaderboard.

2. **Heph (conversational AI mentor)**
   - **SRL-guided reflection:** Run AI-assisted sessions that support goal setting, strategy selection, and reflection aligned with agile rituals.
   - **Automated stand-ups:** Convert insights into a structured weekly stand-up table for streamlined team communication.
